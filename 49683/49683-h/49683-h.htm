    <h2>
      INTRODUCTION
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is fair to characterise the three <i>suites</i> of original
      water-colour drawings, as executed by our artist, as <i>unique</i>
      examples of the great George Cruikshank&rsquo;s special individual proficiency
      as an exponent of this branch of technical dexterity. Moreover, it may be
      regarded as a fortunate circumstance that the three works, here reproduced
      with amazing fidelity in <i>facsimile</i>, represent happily the very <i>chefs
      d&rsquo;oeuvre</i> of his wonderful productions; in their respective categories,
      preserving the best examples of his remarkable genius as an imaginative
      creator of vivid pictures, alike stirring and animated, and representing
      at one glance his vast dramatic powers, his mastery of the humorous side
      of life, and the intensity he was consistently able to infuse into
      terrible and tragic scenes.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is noteworthy that the inimitable artist George Cruikshank but rarely
      produced finished water-colour drawings; the bulk of his prolific and
      familiarly recognised designs for book illustrations were mostly dainty
      pencil sketches, occasionally finished in pen and ink. It is a problem
      difficult to solve satisfactorily whether, beyond the three memorable
      instances of the works here reproduced in <i>facsimile</i>, there are in
      existence any other <i>complete suites</i> of original illustrations by
      George Cruikshank&mdash;that is to say, fully executed by his master hand
      as <i>finished water-colour drawings</i>. Tinted sketches may be found in
      the prized possessions of Cruikshank collectors, and spirited studies for
      many of his favourite and most successful subjects have been cleverly
      touched in with watercolours; for instance, such as certain of his
      original drawings as designed for the illustrations of Harrison
      Ainsworth&rsquo;s <i>Tower of London</i>, and the clever historical and
      picturesque series of <i>Windsor Castle</i> designs; these are, however,
      to be regarded as exceptional cases, for the bulk of these most successful
      and popular designs were carefully executed in pencil, or occasionally
      outlined with the pen, and highly finished with washes of warm sepia. It
      is worthy of recollection that Cruikshank was a most dexterous artist in
      this monochrome branch, his earlier artistic experiences having been
      almost exclusively in the walk of aqua-tinted etchings; all his early book
      illustrations, his caricatures, and satirical plates&mdash;social or
      political&mdash;were uniformly etched by his hand in the most spirited
      fashion, after his ready sketches and rough studies, and when the outline
      etching was bitten in, Cruikshank elaborately worked out his colour
      suggestions, for light and shade, with a brush over the first-etched
      outline, in tones of sepia or Indian ink, for the guidance of the
      professional &lsquo;aquatinters&lsquo;&mdash;the school of artists to whose trained
      skill was entrusted the task of completing these plates to produce the
      effect of highly finished washed drawings in monochrome. By this, his
      youthful practice, George Cruikshank had acquired remarkable dexterity,
      his original pen-and-ink designs, and the outline etchings, after his
      earlier book illustrations, being worked up in monochrome to the dainty
      finish of delicate miniatures, in which art both his father Isaac and his
      brother Isaac Robert were first-class proficients, as he himself has
      recorded with pride in describing the special gifts and qualifications
      which distinguished the Cruikshank family.
    </p>
    <p>
      The present series includes the inimitable <i>suite</i> of designs,
      pictorially unfolding the progress and subsequent dramatic experiences of
      a parish boy, as graphically related by the great literary genius of
      CHARLES DICKENS in the realistic romance, universally appreciated as&mdash;&lsquo;THE
      ADVENTURES OF OLIVER TWIST,&rsquo; with the truly interesting series of
      characteristic pictures, so vividly delineating &lsquo;Life in London&rsquo; in the
      Hogarthian time, at the date of the abortive Jacobite rising in 1745. A
      realistic panoramic <i>suite</i>, introducing marvellously faithful
      pictures of antique localities of the old City of Westminster, with
      life-like studies, reproducing the contemporary aspects of the past, both
      topographically and socially, of the time-renowned pleasure resorts of the
      era, when these amusements were at the height of their vogue, and the
      entertainments which then attracted the crowd. The Mall, St. James&rsquo;s Park,
      with the world of fashion which formed its attraction; &lsquo;The Folly,&rsquo; a
      floating place of entertainment, opposite Somerset House; Marylebone
      Gardens and Vauxhall Gardens at their palmiest date; the gayest souvenirs
      of Ranelagh Gardens, with crowds of fashionable frequenters, and rounds of
      enjoyable amusements. Spirited materials, crowded with literary
      suggestions, which the artist, from his vast experiences of the past,
      rejoiced to thus graphically and realistically furnish to the author to
      further the creation of the sympathetic and brilliant romance,
      subsequently written, embodying the diversified phases of life in antique
      London, as suggested by George Cruikshank&rsquo;s <i>suite</i> of graphic and
      life-like pictures of a brilliant past, which lent their special
      attractions and interest to the most successful and popular novel by
      HARRISON AINSWORTH, &lsquo;THE MISER&rsquo;S DAUGHTER,&rsquo; illustrated with Twenty of
      George Cruikshank&rsquo;s happiest pictures.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the two foregoing and most noteworthy productions are added the third
      <i>suite</i> of original water-colour drawings, the most tragically
      terrible of all George Cruikshank&rsquo;s graphic productions, illustrating in
      the unmistakably realistic manner characteristic of the artist&rsquo;s genius
      for delineating terrifying episodes, exhibiting with all tragic intensity
      and the vigorous force of his imagination the lurid horrors of revolution,
      as disclosed in the horrifying revelations of the sanguinary atrocities
      which ensanguined with floods of gore the chronicles of &lsquo;THE IRISH
      REBELLION OF 1798,&rsquo; as disclosed in the actually terrific and terrifying
      narrative&mdash;MAXWELL&rsquo;S &lsquo;HISTORY.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      George Cruikshank was too candidly honest an artist to conceal his
      appreciative sense of the popular success which these xiii generally
      familiar works had happily secured. The artist himself scorned to disguise
      his pride in &lsquo;these creatures of his brain,&rsquo; as he esteemed them, with
      paternal admiration! On the strength of these famous dramatic <i>suites</i>,
      with the designs so well known as constituting the pictorial skeleton or
      framework of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, the designer extended his claim for
      fuller recognition, to the point of feeling it a deep personal grievance
      that the respective &lsquo;gifted authors&rsquo; had wilfully adopted all his best
      ideas, without the formality of acknowledging their literary obligations
      and indebtedness to the artist himself. To do him full justice, it must be
      acknowledged that from the date of their first appearance in monthly
      parts, Cruikshank made these claims persistently amongst friends and in
      the presence of mutual acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of the injury, fanciful or real, was lengthy and vexatious, and
      for the most part rather filled the minds of the artist&rsquo;s best-wishers
      with dismay; but as there had never been offered during Dickens&rsquo;s lifetime
      any sort of disproof that the &lsquo;Parish Boy&rsquo;s Progress,&rsquo; as a pictorial <i>suite</i>,
      was one of George Cruikshank&rsquo;s numerous fruitful original suggestions, and
      <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i> scheme was obviously completely his own as
      regards the main idea of representing fashionable &lsquo;Life in London&rsquo; in the
      days of Hogarth, just as &lsquo;Life in London&rsquo; of his jaunty youth had been by
      his hand portrayed in the &lsquo;Corinthian epoch&rsquo; of the sportive &lsquo;Tom and
      Jerry&rsquo; doings under the Regency era, the question in some degree resolved
      itself into the distinctions between inspiration and clever hack-work, the
      art of making the best possible use of suggested materials, wherein the
      faculty of imagination makes the workman. The artist demonstrated that his
      genius invented both series graphically, that the drawings, in the first
      instance designed to simply tell the story on his own lines, later
      suggested the development of their ideas to his literary collaborateurs,
      at least as concerns the projection of <i>Oliver Twist</i> and <i>The
      Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i> alike, both series strongly characteristic of
      Cruikshank&rsquo;s own peculiar genius; and confessedly the evidences of the
      drawings completely justify his not unreasonable contention.
    </p>
    <p>
      These original designs, executed as water-colour drawings, are all in
      existence, and are here reproduced in <i>facsimile</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dickens never denied that the artist had in the first instance designed
      the <i>suite</i> of illustrations portraying a parish boy&rsquo;s progress, in
      advance of Boz&rsquo;s undertaking to write <i>Oliver Twist</i>. Nor could
      Ainsworth for an instant assume to claim the first idea of the scheme of
      eighteenth century fashionable &lsquo;Life in London,&rsquo; as it might have unfolded
      itself panoramically to the observation of William Hogarth himself&mdash;the
      effective <i>scenario</i> of <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, in a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, subsequent <i>suites</i>&mdash;of correspondingly graphic and
      melodramatic character&mdash;also similarly dramatised on their
      publication, confirm the <i>bona fides</i> of the artist&rsquo;s somewhat
      startling theory, which proved so disconcerting to the minds of George
      Cruikshank&rsquo;s actual literary collaborateurs.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his monograph&mdash;&lsquo;A Critico-Biographical Essay upon George
      Cruikshank&rsquo;&mdash;Professor William Bates, B.A., has elucidated the
      controversial aspects of these trying questions from his personal
      impressions: &lsquo;In viewing the representation of <i>The Bottle</i>, as
      produced on the stage, an adaptation from Cruikshank&rsquo;s famous series, one
      was much more struck with the artist&rsquo;s talent for seizing upon the most
      dramatic situations of the story for the exercise of the pencil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Moncrieff, so the tale goes (<i>Every Night Booky or Life after Dark</i>,
      1827), when he dramatised for the Adelphi &lsquo;Tom and Jerry&rsquo; (<i>Life in
      London</i>), &lsquo;wrote his piece from Cruikshank&rsquo;s plates,&rsquo; and &lsquo;boiled his
      kettle with Pierce Egan&rsquo;s letterpress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Half a century later, Andrew Halliday, adapting <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>
      for the same theatre, made up his most effective scenes from the designs
      of the artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was on witnessing the performance of this latter, and finding his part
      in its production was totally ignored&mdash;always a sensitive subject
      with the combative veteran&mdash;that George Cruikshank was incited to
      make that public vindication of his claim to a share in the authorship of
      this and other works&mdash;notably <i>Oliver Twist</i>&mdash;illustrated
      by his hand, and involving the candour and sense of justice of Ainsworth,
      Dickens, and himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The aggrieved humorist, who had a fairly founded opinion of his own gifts
      and reputation, and whose imaginative faculties were always abnormally
      fervid, was still full of fight. Dickens had been at rest for two years,
      but his biographer, John Forster, was in the flesh; as was W. Harrison
      Ainsworth, Cruikshank&rsquo;s colleague and partner of the &lsquo;thirties&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;forties,&rsquo; so that it is not surprising to find the artist in 1872&mdash;then
      an octogenarian veteran&mdash;entering fiercely upon a seemingly Quixotic
      campaign against the before-time literary colleagues of his prime era of
      artistic production, the period when his picturesquely dramatic fancy
      evolved <i>The Parish Boys Progress, The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, and
      similarly popularly endorsed emanations of his hand and brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ever the &lsquo;great George&rsquo;s&rsquo; grievance that in his later years the
      public assumed him to be his own descendant of the first or even second
      generation. It was avowedly as a protest against this fairly natural
      assumption that G. Cruikshank had carried out his famous and successful &lsquo;<i>Exeter
      Hall Exhibition</i>&rsquo; in 1863. Under the circumstances related, finding his
      well-recognised name and strongly-marked personality steadily ignored or
      obscured, and smarting under intolerable injustices and accumulated
      grievances&mdash;alike real and imaginary&mdash;the vigorous genius of the
      opening of the eighteenth century, fighting hero as he was
      constitutionally, re-entered the lists to vindicate his name and fame;
      and, as he might well have foreseen, had not the burning sense of
      unmerited wrongs obscured his perceptions, quickly had &lsquo;a pretty quarrel&rsquo; 
      on his hands, his powers of onslaught hampered from the circumstance that
      his present weapon was the pen, whereas his accustomed arm for offence and
      defence was the etching-point, the weapon he had been accustomed to wield
      with fine incisive spirit in earlier conflicts. In the present tourney G.
      C. was confessedly under the manifest disqualification of being &lsquo;out of
      his element.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Open as daylight, &lsquo;a knight <i>sans peur et sans reproche</i>&rsquo;&mdash;he
      gallantly sought to unhorse his wily antagonist. The quarrel has left its
      record in print, in pamphlet form, now reckoned <i>rarissime</i>:&mdash;

    <p>
      THE ARTIST AND THE AUTHOR
    </p>
    <p>
      A statement of facts by the Artist, George Cruikshank, proving that the
      Distinguished Author, Mr. W. Harrison Ainsworth, is <i>labouring under a
      singular delusion</i> with respect to the origin of The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter,
      <i>The Tower of London</i>, etc.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the following letter, which appeared in The Times of the 8th of April
      1872, it will be seen that I therein claimed to be the Originator of a
      tale or romance entitled &lsquo;The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter,&rsquo; which was <i>written</i>
      by Mr. Ainsworth and illustrated by me. G. C.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To the Editor of &lsquo;The Times&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir&mdash;Under the heading of &lsquo;Easter Amusements&rsquo; in <i>The Times</i> of
      the 2nd inst. it is stated that Mr. W. Harrison Ainsworth&rsquo;s novel of <i>The
      Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i> had been dramatized by Mr. Andrew Halliday, and
      produced at the Adelphi Theatre, and as my name is not mentioned in any
      way in connection with the novel&mdash;not even as the illustrator&mdash;I
      shall feel greatly obliged if you will allow me to inform the public
      through the medium of your columns of the fact (which all my private
      friends are aware of) that this tale of <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>
      originated from me, and not from Mr. Ainsworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      My idea suggested to that gentleman was to write a story in which the
      principal character should be a miser, who had a daughter, and that the
      struggles of feelings between the love for his child and his love of money
      should produce certain effects and results; and as all my ancestors were
      mixed up in the Rebellion of &lsquo;45, I suggested that the story should be of
      that date, in order that I might introduce some scenes and circumstances
      connected with that great party struggle; and also wishing to let the
      public of the present day have a peep at the places of amusement of that
      period, I took considerable pains to give correct views and descriptions
      of those places, which are now copied and produced upon the stage; and I
      take this opportunity of complimenting my friend Halliday for the very
      excellent and effective manner in which he has dramatized the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      I do not mean to say that Mr. Ainsworth when writing this novel did not
      introduce some of his own ideas; but as the first idea and all the
      principal points and characters emanated from me, I think it will be
      allowed that the title of <i>originator</i> of <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>
      should be conferred upon, Sir, your obedient servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      George Cruikshank.
    </p>
    <p>
      263 Hampstead Road,
    </p>
    <p>
      6th April 1872.
    </p>
    <p>
      This letter brought forth the following reply from the <i>writer</i> of
      this romance:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To the Editor of &lsquo;The Times&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir&mdash;In a letter from Mr. George Cruikshank which appeared in <i>The
      Times</i> of to-day, that distinguished artist claims to be the originator
      of <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>. I content myself with giving the statement
      a positive contradiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cruikshank appears to labour under a singular delusion in regard to
      novels he has illustrated; it is not long since he claimed to be the
      originator of Mr. Dickens&rsquo;s <i>Oliver Twist</i>.&mdash;Your faithful
      servant,
    </p>
    <p>
      W. Harrison Ainsworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      8th April 1872.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon seeing this &lsquo;positive contradiction,&rsquo; I wrote a second letter to <i>The
      Times</i>, which the Editor kindly inserted:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;THE MISER&rsquo;S DAUGHTER&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Editor of &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir&mdash;I am fully aware that you will not allow any controversy to be
      carried on in <i>The Times</i> upon such a trifling matter as this; but as
      Mr. W. Harrison Ainsworth gives a positive contradiction to my statement
      which appeared in <i>The Times</i> on the 8th inst., I have to beg that
      you will permit me to express my very great surprise at this denial, and
      also to express my regret that his memory should be in such a defective
      state, that he should have forgotten the circumstances and facts as to the
      origin of <i>Oliver Twist</i> and of <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>; and I
      regret also that this contradiction of his will compel me, in justice to
      myself, to give, in a work I am preparing for the press, a full, true, and
      particular account of all the professional transactions between Mr.
      Ainsworth and myself, in which I shall prove, beyond all fear of
      contradiction, that I am the sole originator of what is called Ainsworth&rsquo;s
      <i>Tower of London</i>, as well as another work bearing his name, but the
      ideas and suggestions of which were given to him by, Sir, your obedient
      servant, George Cruikshank.
    </p>
    <p>
      10th April 1872.
    </p>
    <p>
      P.S.&mdash;Allow me to add that it ought to be understood that it is one
      thing for an artist to illustrate an author&rsquo;s own ideas, and quite a
      different matter when a literary man adopts and writes out the ideas of
      another person.
    </p>
    <p>
      This second letter brought forth another <i>contradiction</i> (a <i>flat</i>
      one) from Mr. W. H. A.:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Editor of &lsquo;The Times&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir&mdash;I disdain to reply to Mr. Cruikshank&rsquo;s preposterous assertions,
      except to give them, as before, a flat contradiction.&mdash;Your faithful
      servant, W. Harrison Ainsworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      11th April 1872.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this the Editor added:&mdash;&lsquo;We can publish no more letters on this
      subject.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen in my second letter that I intended to give an explanation
      of this affair in a work I am preparing for the press, but, as &lsquo;delays are
      dangerous,&rsquo; it occurred to me that I had better bring forward my statement
      without <i>delay</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Ainsworth&rsquo;s <i>positive and flat contradictions</i> and his
      contemptible insinuation as to my <i>labouring under a singular delusion</i>
      have led some persons to form erroneous ideas and to draw false
      conclusions upon this question, I feel placed in a very serious position
      as regards my <i>character for truthfulness</i> and the <i>condition of my
      intellect</i>; and I am therefore <i>compelled in self-defence</i> to
      place certain facts before the public to prove beyond the fear of <i>contradiction</i>
      that what I have asserted is the truth, and that it is Mr. Ainsworth who
      is <i>labouring under a delusion</i>, or has unfortunately lost his
      memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      And in order that this question may be clearly understood, I now proceed
      to give a full and particular account of all the professional transactions
      between myself and Mr. W. Harrison Ainsworth when we were both on the most
      friendly terms and both working together to amuse the public; and also to
      show how it was that this friendship and joint labour ceased, now some
      twenty-eight years ago; and although I feel it a positive duty to myself
      to make these statements, it is, nevertheless, to me rather a painful
      task, well knowing that it will place Mr. Ainsworth in a very awkward
      position as regards his conduct towards me, the explanation of which he
      will feel bitterly, but which he has brought upon himself, for had he, in
      common justice, acknowledged that <i>I was the originator of certain ideas
      and characters up to which he had written</i>, the facts which I am now
      about to state would never have been placed before the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      A question has been asked <i>publicly</i>, and which I grant is rather an
      important one in this case, and that is, Why <i>have I not until lately
      claimed to be the originator of &lsquo;Oliver Twist&rsquo;?</i> To this I reply that
      ever since these works were published, and even when they were in
      progress, I have in private society, when conversing upon such matters,
      always explained that the <i>original ideas and characters of these works
      emanated from me</i>, and the reason why I <i>publicly</i> claimed to be
      the originator of <i>Oliver Twist</i> was to defend Dr. K. Shelton
      Mackenzie, who was charged by Mr. John Forster, in his <i>Life of Mr.
      Charles Dickens</i>, with publishing a <i>falsehood</i> (or a word of <i>three
      letters</i> as he describes it; Mr. Forster in a marginal note puts it
      thus: &lsquo;Falsehood ascribed to a distinguished artist&rsquo;), whereas the Doctor
      was only repeating what I had told him at the time <i>Oliver Twist</i> was
      in progress. Mr. Forster designates Dr. Mackenzie&rsquo;s statement as &lsquo;a
      wonderful story,&rsquo; or &lsquo;a marvellous fable,&rsquo; and in a letter from the Doctor
      to the <i>Philadelphia Press</i>, December 19, 1871, he says: &lsquo;My <i>wonderful
      story was printed in an American periodical years before Mr. Dickens died</i>.&rsquo; 
      And then asks, &lsquo;Why did not Mr. Forster inquire into this matter, for
      surely he must have known it?&rsquo; And I presume Mr. Dickens must also have
      heard of this &lsquo;wonderful story,&rsquo; the truth of which he <i>did not deny,
      for this reason&mdash;because he could not!</i> And with respect to Mr.
      Ainsworth&rsquo;s insinuation as to <i>my</i> &lsquo;labouring under a delusion&rsquo; upon
      this point, all my literary friends at that time knew that I was the
      originator of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, and as Mr. A. and I were at that time
      upon such intimate terms, and both working together on <i>Bentley&rsquo;s
      Miscellany</i>, is it at all likely that I should have concealed such a
      fact from him? No! no! he knew this as well as I did, and, therefore, in
      this matter at any rate, it is <i>he</i> who is &lsquo;labouring under a
      delusion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And I will here refer to a part of my letter, which was published in <i>The
      Times</i>, December 30, 1871, upon the origin of <i>Oliver Twist</i>,
      wherein I state that Mr. Ainsworth and Mr. Dickens came together one day
      to my house, upon which occasion it so happened that I then and there <i>described
      and performed</i> the character of &lsquo;Fagin&rsquo; for Mr. Dickens to introduce
      into the work as a &lsquo;receiver of stolen goods,&rsquo; and that some time after
      this, upon seeing Mr. Ainsworth again, he said to me, &lsquo;I was so much
      struck with your description of that Jew to Mr. Dickens that I think you
      and I could do something together.&rsquo; Now I do not know whether Mr.
      Ainsworth has ever made any allusion to this; perhaps he <i>disdains</i>
      to do so; but perhaps he may give this also a &lsquo;positive contradiction&rsquo;;
      and, if he does, then all I have to say is that his memory is gone!
    </p>
    <p>
      I will now explain the reason why I have <i>publicly</i> asserted my right
      as the originator of <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 1st of December 1871 there appeared in No. 28 of <i>The Illustrated
      Review</i> a short Biographical Sketch of Mr. W. Harrison Ainsworth, with
      a portrait of that gentleman; and in the list of the many and various
      works written by him the following are placed in chronological order: <i>No.
      1, Rookwood; 2, Jack Shepherd; 3, Guy Fawkes; 4, The Tower of London; 5,
      Old St. Pau&rsquo;s; 6, The Miser s Daughter; 7, Windsor Castle; 8, St. James&rsquo;s;
      or, The Court of Queen Anne.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, six of these works were illustrated entirely by me, and one&mdash;Windsor
      Castle&mdash;partly so, numbering altogether One Hundred and Forty-Four of
      the very best designs and etchings which I have ever produced; and yet in
      this Biographical Sketch <i>my name</i> is not mentioned in any way as
      connected with these works, which omission, I thought, was not only very
      ungenerous but also very unjust. For, if Mr. W. H. Ainsworth did not
      himself sketch out this &lsquo;Biographical Sketch&rsquo; of himself, he must have
      known full well what the writer was stating; and he might as well have
      said to that gentleman, &lsquo;Just mention that Mr. George Cruikshank
      illustrated <i>several</i> of the novels written by me,&rsquo; and have given
      the titles, and also have acknowledged that I <i>had</i> given him the
      original ideas of <i>three</i> of the tales, and assisted him with
      suggestions when these works were being produced; and, had he done this, I
      should have been satisfied. But to be thus ignored altogether not only
      created a feeling of surprise but also of dissatisfaction. And when it was
      announced that Mr. Andrew Halliday had dramatised Ainsworth&rsquo;s <i>Miser&rsquo;s
      Daughter</i>, I went to see the performance; and when I saw represented on
      the stage <i>scenes and characters which had emanated from me</i> and my
      name not mentioned, I then publicly claimed to to be the <i>originator</i>
      of that romance, and to have suggested the original idea and the
      characters to Mr. Ainsworth.

      parts in <i>Bentley&rsquo;s Miscellany</i>. This story <i>originated from Mr.
      Ainsworth</i>, and, when preparing it for publication, he showed me about
      two or three pages of manuscript on &lsquo;post paper&rsquo;; and <i>I beg that it may
      be observed that this was the only bit of manuscript written by this
      author that I ever saw in the whole course of my life!</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      No. 4, <i>The Tower of London</i>, the Original Idea of which was
      suggested by me to Mr. Ainsworth, and also <i>illustrated</i> by me and
      published in monthly numbers. In this work Mr. Ainsworth and I were <i>partners</i>
      holding equal shares.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now comes the question of how it should so happen, as Mr. W. H.
      Ainsworth and I were such friends and fellow-workers and partners in the
      work of <i>The Tower of London</i>, that he should have got another artist
      to illustrate <i>Old St. Paul&rsquo;s</i> (&lsquo;one of my pet subjects, which I had
      nursed in my brains for years, and which I had long intended to have
      placed before the public with my own hands,&rsquo; as G. C. relates in another
      charge)? And, after that was finished, to have employed a French artist to
      illustrate <i>Windsor Castle</i>. Ay, <i>that is the question!</i> And now
      comes the answer and the reason for this most extraordinary proceeding. I
      must here first state that as large sums of money had been realised from
      my ideas and suggestions for the work of <i>Oliver Twist</i>, it occurred
      to me one day that I would try and get a little of the same material from
      the same source; and as Mr. Ainsworth and I were at that time upon the
      most friendly&mdash;I may say brotherly&mdash;terms, I suggested to him
      that we should jointly produce a work on our own account and publish it in
      monthly numbers, and get Mr. Bentley to join us as the publisher. Mr.
      Ainsworth was delighted with the idea of such a partnership, and at once
      acceded to the proposition; and when I told him that I had a capital
      subject for the first work he inquired what it was, and upon my telling
      him it was <i>The Tower of London</i>, with some incidents in the life of
      Lady Jane Grey, he was still more delighted; and I then told him that I
      had long since seen the room in &lsquo;the Tower&rsquo; where that beautiful and
      accomplished dear lady was imprisoned, and other parts of that fortress to
      which the public were not admitted, and if he would go with me to the
      Tower I would show these places to him. He at once accepted my offer, and
      off we went to &lsquo;Hungerford Stairs,&rsquo; now the site of the Charing Cross
      Railway Station, and whilst waiting on the beach for a boat to go to
      London Bridge, we there met my dear friend the late W. Jordan, the
      well-known editor and part-proprietor of <i>The Literary Gazette</i>, who
      inquired where we were going to. My reply was that I was taking Mr.
      Ainsworth a prisoner to the Tower! With this joke we parted. I then took
      Mr. Ainsworth to the royal prison, and when we arrived there I introduced
      him to my friend Mr. Stacey, the storekeeper, in whose department were
      these &lsquo;Chambers of Horrors&rsquo;; and then and there did Mr. Ainsworth, for the
      first time, see the apartment in which the dear Lady Jane was placed until
      the day she was beheaded, or, in other words, the day on which she was
      murdered, and which place I had long before made sketches of for the
      purpose of introducing them in a <i>Life of Lady Jane Grey</i>, and which
      for many years I had intended to place before the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have now most distinctly to state that Mr. Ainsworth <i>wrote up to most
      of my suggestions and designs</i>, although some of the subjects we <i>jointly</i>
      arranged to introduce into the work; and I used every month to send him
      the <i>tracings or outlines of the sketches or drawings</i> from which I
      was making the etchings to illustrate the work, <i>in order that he might
      write up to them</i>, and that they should be <i>accurately described</i>.
      And I beg the reader to understand that all these <i>etchings or plates
      were printed and ready for publication before the letterpress was printed</i>,
      and sometimes even before the Author <i>had written his manuscript</i>;
      and I assert that I never saw a page of this work <i>until after it was
      published</i>, and then hardly ever read a line of it. It is a curious
      coincidence, but clearly proves what I have just stated with respect to
      these <i>outlines or tracings</i>&mdash;that Mr. Ainsworth in January last
      was applied to for <i>these and other tracings or outlines</i>, and his
      reply was, that &lsquo;<i>he would be very happy to send the tracings mentioned,
      but he had no idea what had become of them, as he had not seen them since
      &lsquo;The Tower of London&rsquo; was published</i>. This letter I have in my
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      This <i>Tower of London</i> became so very popular, that before it was
      finished, a bookseller came to me and said if we brought out another work
      similar in style and interest, that he would take 20,000 a month to begin
      with, and pay ready money for them; and another bookseller offered to take
      25,000 or 30,000 a month upon the same terms.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this work was completed, I told Mr. Ainsworth that I had another
      capital subject for our next work. &lsquo;Ah! what is it?&rsquo; said he; to which I
      replied, &lsquo;The Plague and the Fire of London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; he exclaimed, &lsquo;that <i>is</i> first-rate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      [The aggrieved Artist proceeded to state at length his sense of injury at
      the hands of the Author, who, on the facts set forth, had not considered
      Cruikshank&rsquo;s rights in several instances, notably <i>Old Saint Paul&rsquo;s</i>
      and <i>Windsor Castle</i>. This first break between the partners was
      bridged over, owing to the peace-making overtures of a mutual friend, and
      Cruikshank&rsquo;s publication of The <i>Omnibus</i> was suspended and finally
      abandoned in favour of that artist consenting to collaborate (as in <i>Bentley&rsquo;s
      Miscellany</i>) in a new venture, namely <i>Ainsworth&rsquo;s Magazine</i>.]
    </p>
    <p>
      The Artist&rsquo;s statement is thus continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Before <i>Ainsworth&rsquo;s Magazine</i> was published, advertisements were put
      forth that I, George Cruikshank, was to be the illustrator thereof; and <i>the
      Artist and the Author</i> then held a consultation as to what tale or
      romance we were to commence with, and which I was to <i>illustrate</i>;
      and, well knowing the importance of having <i>an attractive subject for
      the first number of a work, I then suggested to Mr. Ainsworth my idea of
      &lsquo;The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter&rsquo;&rsquo;</i> (the plot of which will be seen in my first
      letter to <i>The Times</i> upon this subject, and which I had originally
      intended to have had written by some literary friend, and published it in
      my &lsquo;Omnibus&rsquo;). This romance (as I expected), <i>with my illustrations, did
      attract</i> the public attention, and did to some extent make this
      magazine a success.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was published in <i>Ainsworth&rsquo;s Magazine</i>, No. 2, March 1842, a
      woodcut of a drawing made by me, <i>at Mr. Ainsworth&rsquo;s suggestion, of the
      Author and the Artist</i>, seated &lsquo;in council,&rsquo; or conversing together in
      his library. And surely this looks as if he then considered me something
      more than a <i>mere illustrator</i> of his magazine.
    </p>
    <p>
      [Then follows a statement of the final break up of the friendly
      collaboration of these old colleagues, explaining the Artist&rsquo;s grievances
      in connection with <i>Windsor Castle</i>&mdash;also contributed to <i>Ainsworth&rsquo;s
      Magazine</i>&mdash;and the fatal ending of these long associations, when
      the Author, unaccountably disregarding Cruikshank&rsquo;s joint interests,
      elected to sell his magazine to the publishers; this seems to have fairly
      disgusted the Artist.] Here is his indignant protest:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      So it really appears as if all this gentleman&rsquo;s promises, like pie-crust,
      were made to be broken; and as, in this instance, also, there was not any
      <i>written agreement</i>, the <i>arrangements</i> which he had made, and
      the <i>engagements</i> he had entered into with me, when I agreed to work
      with him in his magazine, all broke down, and I, as it were, again &lsquo;thrown
      overboard&rsquo; or &lsquo;left in the lurch.&rsquo; And thus ended the second edition of
      this Author&rsquo;s extraordinary conduct towards the <i>Artist</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will not go into the details of how I assisted this <i>Author</i> with
      head and hand work in these novels, but I did my best to design and
      suggest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The foregoing statements will, I think, clearly explain why I have never,
      since that time (written 1872)&mdash;now some twenty-eight years back&mdash;given
      any more <i>original ideas, suggestions, and characters</i> for any other
      tales or romances for Mr. Ainsworth <i>to write up to</i>; and also why I
      have never, from that time, illustrated any of this Author&rsquo;s writings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I now feel it necessary to inform the public that the usual or ordinary
      way of producing illustrated novels or romances is, for an Author either
      to write out, <i>from his own ideas</i>, the whole of the tale, or in
      parts; the <i>manuscript or letterpress</i> of which is then handed to an
      Artist to <i>read and select subjects from</i> for his illustrations, or
      sometimes <i>for the Author to suggest to the Artist</i> such subjects,
      scenes, or parts as he might wish to be illustrated. And I, being known
      generally only as an Artist, or illustrator, it would therefore very
      naturally be supposed that, <i>in all cases</i>, I have merely worked out
      <i>other men&rsquo;s ideas</i>. But, if I have the opportunity, I shall be able
      to show that <i>other men have sometimes worked out my ideas</i>&mdash;but
      this will be for another occasion. And I will now explain that <i>Oliver
      Twist, The Tower of London, The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>, etc., were produced
      in an entirely different manner from what would be considered the usual
      course; for <i>I, the Artist, suggested to the Authors of these works the
      original idea or subject</i>&mdash;for them to write out&mdash;furnishing,
      at the same time, <i>the principal characters and the scenes</i>; and
      then, as the tale had to be produced in monthly parts, <i>the Writer or
      Author, and the Artist</i> had every month to arrange and settle what
      scenes or subjects and characters were to be introduced; and the <i>Author</i>
      had to <i>weave in</i> such scenes as I wished to represent, and sometimes
      I had to work out his suggestions.
    </p>
    <p>
      And as to Mr. W. Harrison Ainsworth&rsquo;s &lsquo;singular delusion&rsquo; of an artist
      claiming to be the originator of works which he had merely illustrated, no
      more absurd or contemptible and rubbishing nonsense could ever be
      conceived; for no artist could possibly be in his right mind who would
      make such a claim, and it becomes a serious question as to whether any one
      who brings forth such nonsense can be in <i>his</i> right mind, and if
      this <i>Author</i> has really lost his memory, and, as an invalid, is
      suffering under &lsquo;<i>singular delusions</i>,&rsquo; he has my pity and
      commiseration.
    </p>
    <p>
      I lay no claim to anything that has <i>originated</i> from the mind of Mr.
      Ainsworth, or any other man, but where <i>the original idea has emanated
      from my own mind</i>, that I feel I have a right to claim, and by that
      right I will stand firm, and I trust that at no distant date I may be able
      to publish what I have already stated, to show the world how these ideas
      originated in my mind, and why I wished to place them before the public.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amongst the many friends who were acquainted with the facts of this case,
      I may mention the names of T. J. Pettigrew (the eminent surgeon), the Rev.
      Canon Barham (author of the <i>Ingoldsby Legends</i>), Laman Blanchard,
      Douglas Jerrold, Albert Smith, Mark Lemon, Gilbert A&rsquo;Becket, John Leech,
      Messrs. Bradbury and Evans, Richard Bentley, the publisher of the <i>Miscellany</i>,
      and many other dear friends, now, to my sorrow, passed away; but there are
      a few still living who are ready to substantiate my statements one a
      clergyman of the City of London, an old member of the Society of
      Antiquaries; another who is a literary man, a member of the Conservative
      Club; and also a dear and valued friend, who is a member of the Athenæum
      Club and Deputy Lord Lieutenant of one of our counties. This friend sent a
      letter to several of the newspapers&mdash;one of which was forwarded to me&mdash;a
      copy of which I here insert:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Origin of the Work entitled &lsquo;The Tower of London&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>To the Editor of the &lsquo;Liverpool Post&rsquo;&rsquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir&mdash;I hope you will allow me to say that it is half a century since
      George Cruikshank has been my intimate and valued friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a vivid recollection of his drawings of the Tower, and of having
      been frequently in company with the artist while these sketches were in
      progress; the strong impression on my mind <i>was</i>, and <i>is</i>, that
      the interesting tale called <i>The Tower of London</i> was mainly written
      up to George Cruikshank&rsquo;s drawings, and that they, in a great measure,
      suggested the story to Mr. Ainsworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think it therefore only right that justice should be done in this matter
      to the veteran artist who for so many years has amused the world, and
      striven to raise its moral tone. I enclose my card, and have the honour to
      be, yours, etc., A. B.

      I must add a postscript to say that respecting <i>The Miser&rsquo;s Daughter</i>
      I know nothing, as I was living on the Continent at the time it was

    <h2>
      CHAPTER I &mdash; TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF
      THE CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH
    </h2>
    <p>
      Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons it
      will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will assign no
      fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns, great or
      small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on a day and
      date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as it can be of
      no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of the business at
      all events; the item of mortality whose name is prefixed to the head of
      this chapter.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and
      trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable doubt
      whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which case it
      is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never have
      appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of pages,
      they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the most concise
      and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the literature of any age or
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a workhouse,
      is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance that can
      possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this particular
      instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could by possibility
      have occurred. The fact is, that there was considerable difficulty in
      inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of respiration,&mdash;a
      troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered necessary to our
      easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a little flock
      mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and the next: the
      balance being decidedly in favour of the latter. Now, if, during this
      brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful grandmothers, anxious
      aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of profound wisdom, he would most
      inevitably and indubitably have been killed in no time. There being nobody
      by, however, but a pauper old woman, who was rendered rather misty by an
      unwonted allowance of beer; and a parish surgeon who did such matters by
      contract; Oliver and Nature fought out the point between them. The result
      was, that, after a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded
      to advertise to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden
      having been imposed upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could
      reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been
      possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer space
      of time than three minutes and a quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his
      lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron
      bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly from
      the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words, &lsquo;Let me
      see the child, and die.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire: giving
      the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately. As the young woman
      spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed&rsquo;s head, said, with more kindness
      than might have been expected of him:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor bless her dear heart, no!&rsquo; interposed the nurse, hastily depositing
      in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which she had been
      tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir, and
      had thirteen children of her own, and all on &lsquo;em dead except two, and them
      in the wurkus with me, she&rsquo;ll know better than to take on in that way,
      bless her dear heart! Think what it is to be a mother, there&rsquo;s a dear
      young lamb do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother&rsquo;s prospects failed in
      producing its due effect. The patient shook her head, and stretched out
      her hand towards the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon deposited it in her arms. She imprinted her cold white lips
      passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face; gazed wildly
      round; shuddered; fell back&mdash;and died. They chafed her breast, hands,
      and temples; but the blood had stopped forever. They talked of hope and
      comfort. They had been strangers too long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!&rsquo; said the surgeon at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, poor dear, so it is!&rsquo; said the nurse, picking up the cork of the
      green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to take
      up the child. &lsquo;Poor dear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,&rsquo; said the
      surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very likely
      it <i>will</i> be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.&rsquo; He put on
      his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door, added, &lsquo;She
      was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was brought here last night,&rsquo; replied the old woman, &lsquo;by the
      overseer&rsquo;s order. She was found lying in the street. She had walked some
      distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came from, or
      where she was going to, nobody knows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand. &lsquo;The old
      story,&rsquo; he said, shaking his head: &lsquo;no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!
      Good-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once
      more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair before
      the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.
    </p>
    <p>
      What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist was!
      Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only covering, he
      might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it would have been
      hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him his proper station
      in society. But now that he was enveloped in the old calico robes which
      had grown yellow in the same service, he was badged and ticketed, and fell
      into his place at once&mdash;a parish child&mdash;the orphan of a
      workhouse&mdash;the humble, half-starved drudge&mdash;to be cuffed and
      buffeted through the world&mdash;despised by all, and pitied by none.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan, left
      to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he would
      have cried the louder.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II &mdash; TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST&rsquo;S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD
    </h2>
    <p>
      For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic
      course of treachery and deception. He was brought up by hand. The hungry
      and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported by the
      workhouse authorities to the parish authorities. The parish authorities
      inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether there was no
      female then domiciled in &lsquo;the house&rsquo; who was in a situation to impart to
      Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of which he stood in need.
      The workhouse authorities replied with humility, that there was not. Upon
      this, the parish authorities magnanimously and humanely resolved, that
      Oliver should be &lsquo;farmed,&rsquo; or, in other words, that he should be
      dispatched to a branch-workhouse some three miles off, where twenty or
      thirty other juvenile offenders against the poor-laws, rolled about the
      floor all day, without the inconvenience of too much food or too much
      clothing, under the parental superintendence of an elderly female, who
      received the culprits at and for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny
      per small head per week. Sevenpence-halfpenny&rsquo;s worth per week is a good
      round diet for a child; a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny,
      quite enough to overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The
      elderly female was a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was
      good for children; and she had a very accurate perception of what was good
      for herself. So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend
      to her own use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a
      shorter allowance than was originally provided for them. Thereby finding
      in the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great
      experimental philosopher.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a
      great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who
      demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw a
      day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and
      rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died, four-and-twenty
      hours before he was to have had his first comfortable bait of air.
      Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the female to whose
      protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a similar result usually
      attended the operation of <i>her</i> system; for at the very moment when
      the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest possible portion of the
      weakest possible food, it did perversely happen in eight and a half cases
      out of ten, either that it sickened from want and cold, or fell into the
      fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by accident; in any one of which
      cases, the miserable little being was usually summoned into another world,
      and there gathered to the fathers it had never known in this.
    </p>
    <p>
      Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest
      upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead, or
      inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a washing&mdash;though
      the latter accident was very scarce, anything approaching to a washing
      being of rare occurrence in the farm&mdash;the jury would take it into
      their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the parishioners would
      rebelliously affix their signatures to a remonstrance. But these
      impertinences were speedily checked by the evidence of the surgeon, and
      the testimony of the beadle; the former of whom had always opened the body
      and found nothing inside (which was very probable indeed), and the latter
      of whom invariably swore whatever the parish wanted; which was very
      self-devotional. Besides, the board made periodical pilgrimages to the
      farm, and always sent the beadle the day before, to say they were going.
      The children were neat and clean to behold, when <i>they</i> went; and
      what more would the people have!
    </p>
    <p>
      It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any very
      extraordinary or luxuriant crop. Oliver Twist&rsquo;s ninth birthday found him a
      pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and decidedly small in
      circumference. But nature or inheritance had implanted a good sturdy
      spirit in Oliver&rsquo;s breast. It had had plenty of room to expand, thanks to
      the spare diet of the establishment; and perhaps to this circumstance may
      be attributed his having any ninth birth-day at all. Be this as it may,
      however, it was his ninth birthday; and he was keeping it in the
      coal-cellar with a select party of two other young gentleman, who, after
      participating with him in a sound thrashing, had been locked up for
      atrociously presuming to be hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the
      house, was unexpectedly startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the
      beadle, striving to undo the wicket of the garden-gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Goodness gracious! Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann,
      thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.
      &lsquo;(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash &lsquo;em directly.)&mdash;My
      heart alive! Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you, sure-ly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of responding
      to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave the little
      wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick which could
      have emanated from no leg but a beadle&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, only think,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann, running out,&mdash;for the three boys
      had been removed by this time,&mdash;&lsquo;only think of that! That I should
      have forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them
      dear children! Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have
      softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the
      beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,&rsquo; inquired Mr.
      Bumble, grasping his cane, &lsquo;to keep the parish officers a waiting at your
      garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with the
      porochial orphans? Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I may say, a
      porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear
      children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,&rsquo; replied Mrs.
      Mann with great humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his importance.
      He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, Mrs. Mann,&rsquo; he replied in a calmer tone; &lsquo;it may be as you
      say; it may be. Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business, and
      have something to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor;
      placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and cane
      on the table before him. Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the
      perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the
      cocked hat, and smiled. Yes, he smiled. Beadles are but men: and Mr.
      Bumble smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now don&rsquo;t you be offended at what I&rsquo;m a going to say,&rsquo; observed Mrs.
      Mann, with captivating sweetness. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve had a long walk, you know, or I
      wouldn&rsquo;t mention it. Now, will you take a little drop of somethink, Mr.
      Bumble?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a drop. Nor a drop,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a
      dignified, but placid manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you will,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the
      refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it. &lsquo;Just a leetle drop,
      with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble coughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, just a leetle drop,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann persuasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; inquired the beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put into
      the blessed infants&rsquo; Daffy, when they ain&rsquo;t well, Mr. Bumble,&rsquo; replied
      Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle and
      glass. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s gin. I&rsquo;ll not deceive you, Mr. B. It&rsquo;s gin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?&rsquo; inquired Bumble, following
      with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, bless &lsquo;em, that I do, dear as it is,&rsquo; replied the nurse. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t
      see &lsquo;em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No&rsquo;; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; &lsquo;no, you could not. You are a humane
      woman, Mrs. Mann.&rsquo; (Here she set down the glass.) &lsquo;I shall take a early
      opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.&rsquo; (He drew it towards
      him.) &lsquo;You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.&rsquo; (He stirred the gin-and-water.)
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I drink your health with cheerfulness, Mrs. Mann&rsquo;; and he
      swallowed half of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now about business,&rsquo; said the beadle, taking out a leathern
      pocket-book. &lsquo;The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine year
      old to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless him!&rsquo; interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the corner
      of her apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was afterwards
      increased to twenty pound. Notwithstanding the most superlative, and, I
      may say, supernat&rsquo;ral exertions on the part of this parish,&rsquo; said Bumble,
      &lsquo;we have never been able to discover who is his father, or what was his
      mother&rsquo;s settlement, name, or condition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection, &lsquo;How comes he to have any name at all, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, &lsquo;I inwented it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You, Mr. Bumble!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, Mrs. Mann. We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last was a
      S,&mdash;Swubble, I named him. This was a T,&mdash;Twist, I named <i>him</i>.
      The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins. I have got names
      ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it again,
      when we come to Z.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re quite a literary character, sir!&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment;
      &lsquo;perhaps I may be. Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.&rsquo; He finished the
      gin-and-water, and added, &lsquo;Oliver being now too old to remain here, the
      board have determined to have him back into the house. I have come out
      myself to take him there. So let me see him at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fetch him directly,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that
      purpose. Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of dirt
      which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed off in
      one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair, and
      the cocked hat on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you go along with me, Oliver?&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great
      readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had
      got behind the beadle&rsquo;s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a
      furious countenance. He took the hint at once, for the fist had been too
      often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his
      recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will she go with me?&rsquo; inquired poor Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;But she&rsquo;ll come and see you
      sometimes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was no very great consolation to the child. Young as he was, however,
      he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at going away.
      It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears into his eyes.
      Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you want to cry; and
      Oliver cried very naturally indeed. Mrs. Mann gave him a thousand
      embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a piece of bread and
      butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got to the workhouse. With
      the slice of bread in his hand, and the little brown-cloth parish cap on
      his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr. Bumble from the wretched home
      where one kind word or look had never lighted the gloom of his infant
      years. And yet he burst into an agony of childish grief, as the
      cottage-gate closed after him. Wretched as were the little companions in
      misery he was leaving behind, they were the only friends he had ever
      known; and a sense of his loneliness in the great wide world, sank into
      the child&rsquo;s heart for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping his
      gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every quarter
      of a mile whether they were &lsquo;nearly there.&rsquo; To these interrogations Mr.
      Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for the temporary
      blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had by this time
      evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an
      hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of
      bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old
      woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him that
      the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was, Oliver
      was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite certain
      whether he ought to laugh or cry. He had no time to think about the
      matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head, with his cane,
      to wake him up: and another on the back to make him lively: and bidding
      him to follow, conducted him into a large white-washed room, where eight
      or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round a table. At the top of the table,
      seated in an arm-chair rather higher than the rest, was a particularly fat
      gentleman with a very round, red face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bow to the board,&rsquo; said Bumble. Oliver brushed away two or three tears
      that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the table,
      fortunately bowed to that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name, boy?&rsquo; said the gentleman in the high chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him
      tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him cry.
      These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating voice;
      whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool. Which was a
      capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite at his ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Boy,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the high chair, &lsquo;listen to me. You know
      you&rsquo;re an orphan, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that, sir?&rsquo; inquired poor Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy <i>is</i> a fool&mdash;I thought he was,&rsquo; said the gentleman in
      the white waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said the gentleman who had spoken first. &lsquo;You know you&rsquo;ve got no
      father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you crying for?&rsquo; inquired the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
      And to be sure it was very extraordinary. What <i>could</i> the boy be
      crying for?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you say your prayers every night,&rsquo; said another gentleman in a
      gruff voice; &lsquo;and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of you&mdash;like
      a Christian.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; stammered the boy. The gentleman who spoke last was
      unconsciously right. It would have been very like a Christian, and a
      marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people who
      fed and took care of <i>him</i>. But he hadn&rsquo;t, because nobody had taught
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,&rsquo; said
      the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o&rsquo;clock,&rsquo; added
      the surly one in the white waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process of
      picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and was
      then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he sobbed
      himself to sleep. What a novel illustration of the tender laws of England!
      They let the paupers go to sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Oliver! He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy
      unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day
      arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence
      over all his future fortunes. But they had. And this was it:
    </p>
    <p>
      The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and
      when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out at
      once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered&mdash;the poor
      people liked it! It was a regular place of public entertainment for the
      poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public
      breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and mortar
      elysium, where it was all play and no work. &lsquo;Oho!&rsquo; said the board, looking
      very knowing; &lsquo;we are the fellows to set this to rights; we&rsquo;ll stop it
      all, in no time.&rsquo; So, they established the rule, that all poor people
      should have the alternative (for they would compel nobody, not they), of
      being starved by a gradual process in the house, or by a quick one out of
      it. With this view, they contracted with the water-works to lay on an
      unlimited supply of water; and with a corn-factor to supply periodically
      small quantities of oatmeal; and issued three meals of thin gruel a day,
      with an onion twice a week, and half a roll of Sundays. They made a great
      many other wise and humane regulations, having reference to the ladies,
      which it is not necessary to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor
      married people, in consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors&rsquo; 
      Commons; and, instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they
      had theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a
      bachelor! There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under these
      last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society, if it had
      not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were long-headed men,
      and had provided for this difficulty. The relief was inseparable from the
      workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened people.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was in
      full operation. It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of the
      increase in the undertaker&rsquo;s bill, and the necessity of taking in the
      clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their wasted,
      shrunken forms, after a week or two&rsquo;s gruel. But the number of workhouse
      inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were in ecstasies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a copper
      at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the purpose,
      and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at mealtimes. Of this
      festive composition each boy had one porringer, and no more&mdash;except
      on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two ounces and a
      quarter of bread besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bowls never wanted washing. The boys polished them with their spoons
      till they shone again; and when they had performed this operation (which
      never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large as the bowls), they
      would sit staring at the copper, with such eager eyes, as if they could
      have devoured the very bricks of which it was composed; employing
      themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers most assiduously, with the
      view of catching up any stray splashes of gruel that might have been cast
      thereon. Boys have generally excellent appetites. Oliver Twist and his
      companions suffered the tortures of slow starvation for three months: at
      last they got so voracious and wild with hunger, that one boy, who was
      tall for his age, and hadn&rsquo;t been used to that sort of thing (for his
      father had kept a small cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that
      unless he had another basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some
      night happen to eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a
      weakly youth of tender age. He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly
      believed him. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the
      master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to Oliver
      Twist.
    </p>
    <p>
      The evening arrived; the boys took their places. The master, in his cook&rsquo;s
      uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants ranged
      themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long grace was said
      over the short commons. The gruel disappeared; the boys whispered each
      other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors nudged him. Child as
      he was, he was desperate with hunger, and reckless with misery. He rose
      from the table; and advancing to the master, basin and spoon in hand,
      said: somewhat alarmed at his own temerity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, sir, I want some more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0049.jpg" alt="0049" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0049.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in
      stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then clung
      for support to the copper. The assistants were paralysed with wonder; the
      boys with fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said the master at length, in a faint voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Please, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver, &lsquo;I want some more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The master aimed a blow at Oliver&rsquo;s head with the ladle; pinioned him in
      his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into the
      room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high chair,
      said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir! Oliver Twist has asked for more!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general start. Horror was depicted on every countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For <i>more</i>!&rsquo; said Mr. Limbkins. &lsquo;Compose yourself, Bumble, and
      answer me distinctly. Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had
      eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He did, sir,&rsquo; replied Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That boy will be hung,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. &lsquo;I
      know that boy will be hung.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman&rsquo;s opinion. An animated
      discussion took place. Oliver was ordered into instant confinement; and a
      bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering a reward
      of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the hands of the
      parish. In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were offered to any
      man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade, business, or calling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never was more convinced of anything in my life,&rsquo; said the gentleman in
      the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill next
      morning: &lsquo;I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than I am
      that that boy will come to be hung.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated gentleman
      was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this narrative
      (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint just yet,
      whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination or no.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III &mdash; RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE
      WHICH WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN A SINECURE
    </h2>
    <p>
      For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of
      asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and solitary
      room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of the board.
      It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose, that, if he had
      entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the prediction of the
      gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have established that sage
      individual&rsquo;s prophetic character, once and for ever, by tying one end of
      his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the wall, and attaching himself to
      the other. To the performance of this feat, however, there was one
      obstacle: namely, that pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of
      luxury, had been, for all future times and ages, removed from the noses of
      paupers by the express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly
      given and pronounced under their hands and seals. There was a still
      greater obstacle in Oliver&rsquo;s youth and childishness. He only cried
      bitterly all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his
      little hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in
      the corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble,
      and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even its
      cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness which
      surrounded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let it not be supposed by the enemies of &lsquo;the system,&rsquo; that, during the
      period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of
      exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious
      consolation. As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was allowed
      to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a stone yard, in
      the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching cold, and caused a
      tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated applications of the
      cane. As for society, he was carried every other day into the hall where
      the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a public warning and
      example. And so far from being denied the advantages of religious
      consolation, he was kicked into the same apartment every evening at
      prayer-time, and there permitted to listen to, and console his mind with,
      a general supplication of the boys, containing a special clause, therein
      inserted by authority of the board, in which they entreated to be made
      good, virtuous, contented, and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins
      and vices of Oliver Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to
      be under the exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of
      wickedness, and an article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced one morning, while Oliver&rsquo;s affairs were in this auspicious and
      comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way down the
      High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means of paying
      certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become rather
      pressing. Mr. Gamfield&rsquo;s most sanguine estimate of his finances could not
      raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount; and, in a
      species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately cudgelling his
      brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his eyes encountered
      the bill on the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wo&mdash;o!&rsquo; said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,
      whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when he
      had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was
      laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but
      more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow on
      his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a donkey&rsquo;s.
      Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp wrench, by way
      of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and by these means
      turned him round. He then gave him another blow on the head, just to stun
      him till he came back again. Having completed these arrangements, he
      walked up to the gate, to read the bill.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with his
      hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound
      sentiments in the board-room. Having witnessed the little dispute between
      Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that person came up
      to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield was exactly the
      sort of master Oliver Twist wanted. Mr. Gamfield smiled, too, as he
      perused the document; for five pounds was just the sum he had been wishing
      for; and, as to the boy with which it was encumbered, Mr. Gamfield,
      knowing what the dietary of the workhouse was, well knew he would be a
      nice small pattern, just the very thing for register stoves. So, he spelt
      the bill through again, from beginning to end; and then, touching his fur
      cap in token of humility, accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to &lsquo;prentis,&rsquo; said Mr. Gamfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, my man,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a
      condescending smile. &lsquo;What of him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a good
      &lsquo;spectable chimbley-sweepin&rsquo; bisness,&rsquo; said Mr. Gamfield, &lsquo;I wants a
      &lsquo;prentis, and I am ready to take him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walk in,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. Mr. Gamfield having
      lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head, and another
      wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his absence, followed
      the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room where Oliver had
      first seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a nasty trade,&rsquo; said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated
      his wish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,&rsquo; said another
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley to
      make &lsquo;em come down again,&rsquo; said Gamfield; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all smoke, and no blaze;
      vereas smoke ain&rsquo;t o&rsquo; no use at all in making a boy come down, for it only
      sinds him to sleep, and that&rsquo;s wot he likes. Boys is wery obstinit, and
      wery lazy, Gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men, and there&rsquo;s nothink like a good hot blaze to make
      &lsquo;em come down vith a run. It&rsquo;s humane too, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men, acause, even if
      they&rsquo;ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet makes &lsquo;em struggle to
      hextricate theirselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this
      explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.
      Limbkins. The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a few
      minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words &lsquo;saving of expenditure,&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;looked well in the accounts,&rsquo; &lsquo;have a printed report published,&rsquo; were
      alone audible. These only chanced to be heard, indeed, or account of their
      being very frequently repeated with great emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having
      resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have considered your proposition, and we don&rsquo;t approve of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Decidedly not,&rsquo; added the other members.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of having
      bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him that the
      board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into their heads
      that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their proceedings. It
      was very unlike their general mode of doing business, if they had; but
      still, as he had no particular wish to revive the rumour, he twisted his
      cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you won&rsquo;t let me have him, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men?&rsquo; said Mr. Gamfield, pausing near
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Mr. Limbkins; &lsquo;at least, as it&rsquo;s a nasty business, we think
      you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gamfield&rsquo;s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he returned
      to the table, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;ll you give, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men? Come! Don&rsquo;t be too hard on a poor man.
      What&rsquo;ll you give?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should say, three pound ten was plenty,&rsquo; said Mr. Limbkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ten shillings too much,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said Gamfield; &lsquo;say four pound, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men. Say four pound, and
      you&rsquo;ve got rid of him for good and all. There!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three pound ten,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come! I&rsquo;ll split the diff&rsquo;erence, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men,&rsquo; urged Gamfield. &lsquo;Three
      pound fifteen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a farthing more,&rsquo; was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re desperate hard upon me, gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men,&rsquo; said Gamfield, wavering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh! pooh! nonsense!&rsquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat. &lsquo;He&rsquo;d
      be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly fellow!
      He&rsquo;s just the boy for you. He wants the stick, now and then: it&rsquo;ll do him
      good; and his board needn&rsquo;t come very expensive, for he hasn&rsquo;t been
      overfed since he was born. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,
      observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.
      The bargain was made. Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver Twist
      and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for
      signature and approval, that very afternoon.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </h5>
    <p>
      In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive
      astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself into a
      clean shirt. He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic
      performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin of
      gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of bread. At
      this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously: thinking, not
      unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill him for some
      useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten him up in that
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a going to be
      made a &lsquo;prentice of, Oliver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A prentice, sir!&rsquo; said the child, trembling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Oliver,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;The kind and blessed gentleman which is
      so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are a
      going to &lsquo;prentice&rsquo; you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of you:
      although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!&mdash;three pound
      ten, Oliver!&mdash;seventy shillins&mdash;one hundred and forty sixpences!&mdash;and
      all for a naughty orphan which nobody can&rsquo;t love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in an
      awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child&rsquo;s face, and he sobbed
      bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying to
      his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced; &lsquo;Come,
      Oliver! Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don&rsquo;t cry into
      your gruel; that&rsquo;s a very foolish action, Oliver.&rsquo; It certainly was, for
      there was quite enough water in it already.
    </p>
    <p>
      On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all he
      would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the gentleman
      asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like it very much
      indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey: the rather as
      Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in either particular,
      there was no telling what would be done to him. When they arrived at the
      office, he was shut up in a little room by himself, and admonished by Mr.
      Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour. At the
      expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned with the
      cocked hat, and said aloud:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.&rsquo; As Mr. Bumble said this, he
      put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice, &lsquo;Mind what
      I told you, you young rascal!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s face at this somewhat
      contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his offering
      any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining room: the
      door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great window. Behind a
      desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one of whom was reading
      the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with the aid of a pair of
      tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of parchment which lay before
      him. Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of the desk on one side; and Mr.
      Gamfield, with a partially washed face, on the other; while two or three
      bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were lounging about.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the little
      bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had been
      stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the boy, your worship,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a
      moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon, the
      last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, is this the boy?&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is him, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;Bow to the magistrate, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance. He had been wondering,
      with his eyes fixed on the magistrates&rsquo; powder, whether all boards were
      born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards from
      thenceforth on that account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;I suppose he&rsquo;s fond of chimney-sweeping?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He doats on it, your worship,&rsquo; replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly pinch,
      to intimate that he had better not say he didn&rsquo;t.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he <i>will</i> be a sweep, will he?&rsquo; inquired the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he&rsquo;d run away
      simultaneous, your worship,&rsquo; replied Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this man that&rsquo;s to be his master&mdash;you, sir&mdash;you&rsquo;ll treat
      him well, and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?&rsquo; said the
      old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I says I will, I means I will,&rsquo; replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest, open-hearted
      man,&rsquo; said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in the direction of
      the candidate for Oliver&rsquo;s premium, whose villainous countenance was a
      regular stamped receipt for cruelty. But the magistrate was half blind and
      half childish, so he couldn&rsquo;t reasonably be expected to discern what other
      people did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I am, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no doubt you are, my friend,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman: fixing
      his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the
      inkstand.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the critical moment of Oliver&rsquo;s fate. If the inkstand had been
      where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen into
      it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been straightway
      hurried off. But, as it chanced to be immediately under his nose, it
      followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over his desk for it,
      without finding it; and happening in the course of his search to look
      straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and terrified face of
      Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks and pinches of Bumble,
      was regarding the repulsive countenance of his future master, with a
      mingled expression of horror and fear, too palpable to be mistaken, even
      by a half-blind magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to
      Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and unconcerned
      aspect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My boy!&rsquo; said the old gentleman, &lsquo;you look pale and alarmed. What is the
      matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand a little away from him, Beadle,&rsquo; said the other magistrate: laying
      aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of interest. &lsquo;Now,
      boy, tell us what&rsquo;s the matter: don&rsquo;t be afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that
      they would order him back to the dark room&mdash;that they would starve
      him&mdash;beat him&mdash;kill him if they pleased&mdash;rather than send
      him away with that dreadful man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most impressive
      solemnity. &lsquo;Well! of all the artful and designing orphans that ever I see,
      Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, Beadle,&rsquo; said the second old gentleman, when Mr. Bumble
      had given vent to this compound adjective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your worship&rsquo;s pardon,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having
      heard aright. &lsquo;Did your worship speak to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Hold your tongue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment. A beadle ordered to hold his
      tongue! A moral revolution!
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his
      companion, he nodded significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We refuse to sanction these indentures,&rsquo; said the old gentleman: tossing
      aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; stammered Mr. Limbkins: &lsquo;I hope the magistrates will not form
      the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper conduct,
      on the unsupported testimony of a child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the
      matter,&rsquo; said the second old gentleman sharply. &lsquo;Take the boy back to the
      workhouse, and treat him kindly. He seems to want it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively
      and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he
      would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his head
      with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good; whereunto
      Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him; which, although
      he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem to be a wish of a
      totally opposite description.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was
      again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would take
      possession of him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV &mdash; OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST
      ENTRY INTO PUBLIC LIFE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained, either
      in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the young man who
      is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to sea. The board,
      in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took counsel together on
      the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in some small trading vessel
      bound to a good unhealthy port. This suggested itself as the very best
      thing that could possibly be done with him: the probability being, that
      the skipper would flog him to death, in a playful mood, some day after
      dinner, or would knock his brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes
      being, as is pretty generally known, very favourite and common recreations
      among gentleman of that class. The more the case presented itself to the
      board, in this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step
      appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of providing
      for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries, with
      the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a cabin-boy
      without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to communicate the
      result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate, no less a person
      than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit of
      threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour, and
      shoes to answer. His features were not naturally intended to wear a
      smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional
      jocosity. His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward pleasantry,
      as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by the hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.
      Bumble,&rsquo; said the undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,&rsquo; said the beadle, as he thrust
      his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the undertaker:
      which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin. &lsquo;I say you&rsquo;ll make
      your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Bumble, tapping the undertaker
      on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his cane.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think so?&rsquo; said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half
      disputed the probability of the event. &lsquo;The prices allowed by the board
      are very small, Mr. Bumble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So are the coffins,&rsquo; replied the beadle: with precisely as near an
      approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be; and
      laughed a long time without cessation. &lsquo;Well, well, Mr. Bumble,&rsquo; he said
      at length, &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no denying that, since the new system of feeding has
      come in, the coffins are something narrower and more shallow than they
      used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble. Well-seasoned timber
      is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron handles come, by canal,
      from Birmingham.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, &lsquo;every trade has its drawbacks. A fair
      profit is, of course, allowable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, of course,&rsquo; replied the undertaker; &lsquo;and if I don&rsquo;t get a
      profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the
      long-run, you see&mdash;he! he! he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Though I must say,&rsquo; continued the undertaker, resuming the current of
      observations which the beadle had interrupted: &lsquo;though I must say, Mr.
      Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage: which
      is, that all the stout people go off the quickest. The people who have
      been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the first to sink
      when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr. Bumble, that three
      or four inches over one&rsquo;s calculation makes a great hole in one&rsquo;s profits:
      especially when one has a family to provide for, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an ill-used
      man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a reflection
      on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it advisable to
      change the subject. Oliver Twist being uppermost in his mind, he made him
      his theme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By the bye,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t know anybody who wants a boy, do
      you? A porochial &lsquo;prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a millstone,
      as I may say, round the porochial throat? Liberal terms, Mr. Sowerberry,
      liberal terms?&rsquo; As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his cane to the bill above
      him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words &lsquo;five pounds&rsquo;: which were
      printed thereon in Roman capitals of gigantic size.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gadso!&rsquo; said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged lappel
      of his official coat; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s just the very thing I wanted to speak to you
      about. You know&mdash;dear me, what a very elegant button this is, Mr.
      Bumble! I never noticed it before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I think it rather pretty,&rsquo; said the beadle, glancing proudly
      downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. &lsquo;The die
      is the same as the porochial seal&mdash;the Good Samaritan healing the
      sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear&rsquo;s morning,
      Mr. Sowerberry. I put it on, I remember, for the first time, to attend the
      inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway at midnight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I recollect,&rsquo; said the undertaker. &lsquo;The jury brought it in, &ldquo;Died from
      exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,&rdquo; didn&rsquo;t
      they?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And they made it a special verdict, I think,&rsquo; said the undertaker, &lsquo;by
      adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tush! Foolery!&rsquo; interposed the beadle. &lsquo;If the board attended to all the
      nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they&rsquo;d have enough to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very true,&rsquo; said the undertaker; &lsquo;they would indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Juries,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont when
      working into a passion: &lsquo;juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling
      wretches.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So they are,&rsquo; said the undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They haven&rsquo;t no more philosophy nor political economy about &lsquo;em than
      that,&rsquo; said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more they have,&rsquo; acquiesced the undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I despise &lsquo;em,&rsquo; said the beadle, growing very red in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; rejoined the undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I only wish we&rsquo;d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for a
      week or two,&rsquo; said the beadle; &lsquo;the rules and regulations of the board
      would soon bring their spirit down for &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let &lsquo;em alone for that,&rsquo; replied the undertaker. So saying, he smiled,
      approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the inside
      of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his rage had
      engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the undertaker,
      said in a calmer voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well; what about the boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; replied the undertaker; &lsquo;why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good
      deal towards the poor&rsquo;s rates.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied the undertaker, &lsquo;I was thinking that if I pay so much
      towards &lsquo;em, I&rsquo;ve a right to get as much out of &lsquo;em as I can, Mr. Bumble;
      and so&mdash;I think I&rsquo;ll take the boy myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the
      building. Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes; and
      it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening &lsquo;upon liking&rsquo;&mdash;a
      phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that if the master
      find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out of a boy without
      putting too much food into him, he shall have him for a term of years, to
      do what he likes with.
    </p>
    <p>
      When little Oliver was taken before &lsquo;the gentlemen&rsquo; that evening; and
      informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a
      coffin-maker&rsquo;s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever came
      back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be drowned, or
      knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so little emotion,
      that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened young rascal, and
      ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the
      world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror at
      the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they were
      rather out, in this particular instance. The simple fact was, that Oliver,
      instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather too much; and
      was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state of brutal
      stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received. He heard the
      news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having had his luggage
      put into his hand&mdash;which was not very difficult to carry, inasmuch as
      it was all comprised within the limits of a brown paper parcel, about half
      a foot square by three inches deep&mdash;he pulled his cap over his eyes;
      and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s coat cuff, was led away by
      that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark; for
      the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should: and, it
      being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by the skirts
      of Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to great advantage
      his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches. As they drew near to
      their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it expedient to look down,
      and see that the boy was in good order for inspection by his new master:
      which he accordingly did, with a fit and becoming air of gracious
      patronage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oliver!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of his
      unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them when he
      looked up at his conductor. As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon him, it
      rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another. The child
      made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one. Withdrawing his
      other hand from Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s he covered his face with both; and wept until
      the tears sprung out from between his chin and bony fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little
      charge a look of intense malignity. &lsquo;Well! Of <i>all</i> the
      ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are the&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, sir,&rsquo; sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the
      well-known cane; &lsquo;no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I
      will, sir! I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so&mdash;so&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So what?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So lonely, sir! So very lonely!&rsquo; cried the child. &lsquo;Everybody hates me.
      Oh! sir, don&rsquo;t, don&rsquo;t pray be cross to me!&rsquo; The child beat his hand upon
      his heart; and looked in his companion&rsquo;s face, with tears of real agony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver&rsquo;s piteous and helpless look, with some
      astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky
      manner; and after muttering something about &lsquo;that troublesome cough,&rsquo; bade
      Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his hand, he
      walked on with him in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was making
      some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate dismal
      candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in the
      middle of a word; &lsquo;is that you, Bumble?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,&rsquo; replied the beadle. &lsquo;Here! I&rsquo;ve brought the
      boy.&rsquo; Oliver made a bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! that&rsquo;s the boy, is it?&rsquo; said the undertaker: raising the candle above
      his head, to get a better view of Oliver. &lsquo;Mrs. Sowerberry, will you have
      the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and presented
      the form of a short, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, &lsquo;this is the boy from the
      workhouse that I told you of.&rsquo; Oliver bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; said the undertaker&rsquo;s wife, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s very small.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he <i>is</i> rather small,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as
      if it were his fault that he was no bigger; &lsquo;he is small. There&rsquo;s no
      denying it. But he&rsquo;ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry&mdash;he&rsquo;ll grow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! I dare say he will,&rsquo; replied the lady pettishly, &lsquo;on our victuals and
      our drink. I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they always cost
      more to keep, than they&rsquo;re worth. However, men always think they know
      best. There! Get downstairs, little bag o&rsquo; bones.&rsquo; With this, the
      undertaker&rsquo;s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down a steep
      flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the ante-room
      to the coal-cellar, and denominated &lsquo;kitchen&rsquo;; wherein sat a slatternly
      girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very much out of
      repair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here, Charlotte,&rsquo; said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,
      &lsquo;give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip. He hasn&rsquo;t
      come home since the morning, so he may go without &lsquo;em. I dare say the boy
      isn&rsquo;t too dainty to eat &lsquo;em&mdash;are you, boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was
      trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a
      plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall within
      him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen Oliver Twist
      clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected. I wish he could
      have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver tore the bits
      asunder with all the ferocity of famine. There is only one thing I should
      like better; and that would be to see the Philosopher making the same sort
      of meal himself, with the same relish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the undertaker&rsquo;s wife, when Oliver had finished his supper:
      which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful auguries of his
      future appetite: &lsquo;have you done?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the
      affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then come with me,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty lamp,
      and leading the way upstairs; &lsquo;your bed&rsquo;s under the counter. You don&rsquo;t
      mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn&rsquo;t much matter
      whether you do or don&rsquo;t, for you can&rsquo;t sleep anywhere else. Come; don&rsquo;t
      keep me here all night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.

      CHAPTER V &mdash; OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES. GOING TO A FUNERAL
      FOR THE FIRST TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER&rsquo;S
      BUSINESS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker&rsquo;s shop, set the lamp down
      on a workman&rsquo;s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling of awe
      and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be at no loss
      to understand. An unfinished coffin on black tressels, which stood in the
      middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like that a cold tremble
      came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the direction of the dismal
      object: from which he almost expected to see some frightful form slowly
      rear its head, to drive him mad with terror. Against the wall were ranged,
      in regular array, a long row of elm boards cut in the same shape: looking
      in the dim light, like high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their
      breeches pockets. Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and
      shreds of black cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the
      counter was ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very
      stiff neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by
      four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and
      hot. The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins. The recess
      beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust, looked like a
      grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was
      alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the
      best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no friends
      to care for, or to care for him. The regret of no recent separation was
      fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and well-remembered face sank
      heavily into his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept into
      his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be lain in a
      calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the tall grass
      waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep bell to soothe
      him in his sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of
      the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was repeated,
      in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times. When he began
      to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open the door, will yer?&rsquo; cried the voice which belonged to the legs
      which had kicked at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will, directly, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning
      the key.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose yer the new boy, ain&rsquo;t yer?&rsquo; said the voice through the
      key-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How old are yer?&rsquo; inquired the voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ten, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll whop yer when I get in,&rsquo; said the voice; &lsquo;you just see if I
      don&rsquo;t, that&rsquo;s all, my work&rsquo;us brat!&rsquo; and having made this obliging
      promise, the voice began to whistle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very
      expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the
      smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would
      redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a
      trembling hand, and opened the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street,
      and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had
      addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm
      himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post in
      front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut into
      wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then consumed with
      great dexterity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver at length: seeing that no other
      visitor made his appearance; &lsquo;did you knock?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I kicked,&rsquo; replied the charity-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you want a coffin, sir?&rsquo; inquired Oliver, innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver
      would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yer don&rsquo;t know who I am, I suppose, Work&rsquo;us?&rsquo; said the charity-boy, in
      continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with
      edifying gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m Mister Noah Claypole,&rsquo; said the charity-boy, &lsquo;and you&rsquo;re under me.
      Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!&rsquo; With this, Mr. Claypole
      administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a dignified air,
      which did him great credit. It is difficult for a large-headed, small-eyed
      youth, of lumbering make and heavy countenance, to look dignified under
      any circumstances; but it is more especially so, when superadded to these
      personal attractions are a red nose and yellow smalls.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in his
      effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a small
      court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the day, was
      graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the assurance
      that &lsquo;he&rsquo;d catch it,&rsquo; condescended to help him. Mr. Sowerberry came down
      soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry appeared. Oliver having
      &lsquo;caught it,&rsquo; in fulfilment of Noah&rsquo;s prediction, followed that young
      gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come near the fire, Noah,&rsquo; said Charlotte. &lsquo;I saved a nice little bit of
      bacon for you from master&rsquo;s breakfast. Oliver, shut that door at Mister
      Noah&rsquo;s back, and take them bits that I&rsquo;ve put out on the cover of the
      bread-pan. There&rsquo;s your tea; take it away to that box, and drink it there,
      and make haste, for they&rsquo;ll want you to mind the shop. D&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&rsquo;ye hear, Work&rsquo;us?&rsquo; said Noah Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, Noah!&rsquo; said Charlotte, &lsquo;what a rum creature you are! Why don&rsquo;t you
      let the boy alone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him alone!&rsquo; said Noah. &lsquo;Why everybody lets him alone enough, for the
      matter of that. Neither his father nor his mother will ever interfere with
      him. All his relations let him have his own way pretty well. Eh,
      Charlotte? He! he! he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you queer soul!&rsquo; said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in
      which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully at
      poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest corner of
      the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially reserved for
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan. No chance-child was
      he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his parents, who
      lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his father a drunken
      soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal pension of
      twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction. The shop-boys in the
      neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding Noah in the public
      streets, with the ignominious epithets of &lsquo;leathers,&rsquo; &lsquo;charity,&rsquo; and the
      like; and Noah had bourne them without reply. But, now that fortune had
      cast in his way a nameless orphan, at whom even the meanest could point
      the finger of scorn, he retorted on him with interest. This affords
      charming food for contemplation. It shows us what a beautiful thing human
      nature may be made to be; and how impartially the same amiable qualities
      are developed in the finest lord and the dirtiest charity-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker&rsquo;s some three weeks or a
      month. Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry&mdash;the shop being shut up&mdash;were
      taking their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after
      several deferential glances at his wife, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear&mdash;&rsquo; He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking
      up, with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, my dear, nothing,&rsquo; said Mr. Sowerberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ugh, you brute!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Sowerberry humbly. &lsquo;I thought you didn&rsquo;t
      want to hear, my dear. I was only going to say&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell me what you were going to say,&rsquo; interposed Mrs.
      Sowerberry. &lsquo;I am nobody; don&rsquo;t consult me, pray. <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t want to
      intrude upon your secrets.&rsquo; As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an
      hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, my dear,&rsquo; said Sowerberry, &lsquo;I want to ask your advice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, don&rsquo;t ask mine,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting manner:
      &lsquo;ask somebody else&rsquo;s.&rsquo; Here, there was another hysterical laugh, which
      frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much. This is a very common and
      much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is often very
      effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as a special
      favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most curious to
      hear. After a short duration, the permission was most graciously conceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s only about young Twist, my dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Sowerberry. &lsquo;A very
      good-looking boy, that, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He need be, for he eats enough,&rsquo; observed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,&rsquo; resumed Mr.
      Sowerberry, &lsquo;which is very interesting. He would make a delightful mute,
      my love.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable wonderment.
      Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for any observation
      on the good lady&rsquo;s part, proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but only
      for children&rsquo;s practice. It would be very new to have a mute in
      proportion, my dear. You may depend upon it, it would have a superb
      effect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way, was
      much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been
      compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances,
      she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious suggestion
      had not presented itself to her husband&rsquo;s mind before? Mr. Sowerberry
      rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his proposition; it was
      speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should be at once initiated
      into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this view, that he should
      accompany his master on the very next occasion of his services being
      required.
    </p>
    <p>
      The occasion was not long in coming. Half an hour after breakfast next
      morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against the
      counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he selected
      a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance;
      &lsquo;an order for a coffin, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like
      himself, was very corpulent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bayton,&rsquo; said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.
      Bumble. &lsquo;I never heard the name before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bumble shook his head, as he replied, &lsquo;Obstinate people, Mr. Sowerberry;
      very obstinate. Proud, too, I&rsquo;m afraid, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proud, eh?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer. &lsquo;Come, that&rsquo;s too
      much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s sickening,&rsquo; replied the beadle. &lsquo;Antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; acquiesced the undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We only heard of the family the night before last,&rsquo; said the beadle; &lsquo;and
      we shouldn&rsquo;t have known anything about them, then, only a woman who lodges
      in the same house made an application to the porochial committee for them
      to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was very bad. He had gone
      out to dinner; but his &lsquo;prentice (which is a very clever lad) sent &lsquo;em
      some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, there&rsquo;s promptness,&rsquo; said the undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Promptness, indeed!&rsquo; replied the beadle. &lsquo;But what&rsquo;s the consequence;
      what&rsquo;s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir? Why, the husband
      sends back word that the medicine won&rsquo;t suit his wife&rsquo;s complaint, and so
      she shan&rsquo;t take it&mdash;says she shan&rsquo;t take it, sir! Good, strong,
      wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish labourers
      and a coal-heaver, only a week before&mdash;sent &lsquo;em for nothing, with a
      blackin&rsquo;-bottle in,&mdash;and he sends back word that she shan&rsquo;t take it,
      sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s mind in full force, he
      struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with
      indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the undertaker, &lsquo;I ne&mdash;ver&mdash;did&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never did, sir!&rsquo; ejaculated the beadle. &lsquo;No, nor nobody never did; but
      now she&rsquo;s dead, we&rsquo;ve got to bury her; and that&rsquo;s the direction; and the
      sooner it&rsquo;s done, the better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a fever
      of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!&rsquo; said
      Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of sight,
      during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at the mere
      recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He needn&rsquo;t haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s glance,
      however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman in
      the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that now
      the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better avoided,
      until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years, and all
      danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish should be thus
      effectually and legally overcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, &lsquo;the sooner this job is
      done, the better. Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap, and
      come with me.&rsquo; Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his professional
      mission.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely
      inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street more
      dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused to look
      for the house which was the object of their search. The houses on either
      side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by people of the
      poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have sufficiently
      denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the squalid looks of
      the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies half doubled,
      occasionally skulked along. A great many of the tenements had shop-fronts;
      but these were fast closed, and mouldering away; only the upper rooms
      being inhabited. Some houses which had become insecure from age and decay,
      were prevented from falling into the street, by huge beams of wood reared
      against the walls, and firmly planted in the road; but even these crazy
      dens seemed to have been selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless
      wretches, for many of the rough boards which supplied the place of door
      and window, were wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide
      enough for the passage of a human body. The kennel was stagnant and
      filthy. The very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its
      rottenness, were hideous with famine.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver
      and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark
      passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the
      undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs. Stumbling
      against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen. The undertaker at
      once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the apartment
      to which he had been directed. He stepped in; Oliver followed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically, over
      the empty stove. An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the cold
      hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged children in
      another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door, there lay upon
      the ground, something covered with an old blanket. Oliver shuddered as he
      cast his eyes toward the place, and crept involuntarily closer to his
      master; for though it was covered up, the boy felt that it was a corpse.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man&rsquo;s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly;
      his eyes were bloodshot. The old woman&rsquo;s face was wrinkled; her two
      remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright and
      piercing. Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man. They seemed
      so like the rats he had seen outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody shall go near her,&rsquo; said the man, starting fiercely up, as the
      undertaker approached the recess. &lsquo;Keep back! Damn you, keep back, if
      you&rsquo;ve a life to lose!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense, my good man,&rsquo; said the undertaker, who was pretty well used to
      misery in all its shapes. &lsquo;Nonsense!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you,&rsquo; said the man: clenching his hands, and stamping furiously on
      the floor,&mdash;&lsquo;I tell you I won&rsquo;t have her put into the ground. She
      couldn&rsquo;t rest there. The worms would worry her&mdash;not eat her&mdash;she
      is so worn away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape from
      his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at the
      feet of the dead woman; &lsquo;kneel down, kneel down&mdash;kneel round her,
      every one of you, and mark my words! I say she was starved to death. I
      never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then her
      bones were starting through the skin. There was neither fire nor candle;
      she died in the dark&mdash;in the dark! She couldn&rsquo;t even see her
      children&rsquo;s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged
      for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back, she
      was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they starved
      her to death. I swear it before the God that saw it! They starved her!&rsquo; He
      twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud scream, rolled grovelling
      upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam covering his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had hitherto
      remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that passed,
      menaced them into silence. Having unloosened the cravat of the man who
      still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the
      undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was my daughter,&rsquo; said the old woman, nodding her head in the
      direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more ghastly
      than even the presence of death in such a place. &lsquo;Lord, Lord! Well, it <i>is</i>
      strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman then, should be
      alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and stiff! Lord, Lord!&mdash;to
      think of it; it&rsquo;s as good as a play&mdash;as good as a play!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment,
      the undertaker turned to go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, stop!&rsquo; said the old woman in a loud whisper. &lsquo;Will she be buried
      to-morrow, or next day, or to-night? I laid her out; and I must walk, you
      know. Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is bitter cold. We
      should have cake and wine, too, before we go! Never mind; send some bread&mdash;only
      a loaf of bread and a cup of water. Shall we have some bread, dear?&rsquo; she
      said eagerly: catching at the undertaker&rsquo;s coat, as he once more moved
      towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said the undertaker, &lsquo;of course. Anything you like!&rsquo; He
      disengaged himself from the old woman&rsquo;s grasp; and, drawing Oliver after
      him, hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a
      half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble
      himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where Mr.
      Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the workhouse,
      who were to act as bearers. An old black cloak had been thrown over the
      rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin having been screwed
      down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers, and carried into the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!&rsquo; whispered Sowerberry
      in the old woman&rsquo;s ear; &lsquo;we are rather late; and it won&rsquo;t do, to keep the
      clergyman waiting. Move on, my men,&mdash;as quick as you like!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the
      two mourners kept as near them, as they could. Mr. Bumble and Sowerberry
      walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs were not so
      long as his master&rsquo;s, ran by the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had
      anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the
      churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were
      made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by the
      vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it might
      be an hour or so, before he came. So, they put the bier on the brink of
      the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp clay, with a
      cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the spectacle had
      attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at hide-and-seek among
      the tombstones, or varied their amusements by jumping backwards and
      forwards over the coffin. Mr. Sowerberry and Bumble, being personal
      friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him, and read the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble, and
      Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.
      Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice as
      he came along. Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up
      appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the burial
      service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his surplice to the
      clerk, and walked away again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Bill!&rsquo; said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. &lsquo;Fill up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the
      uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface. The grave-digger
      shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his feet: shouldered
      his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who murmured very loud
      complaints at the fun being over so soon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, my good fellow!&rsquo; said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. &lsquo;They
      want to shut up the yard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the
      grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had
      addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a swoon.
      The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss of her
      cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any attention; so
      they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came to, saw him
      safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed on their
      different ways.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Oliver,&rsquo; said Sowerberry, as they walked home, &lsquo;how do you like
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well, thank you, sir&rsquo; replied Oliver, with considerable
      hesitation. &lsquo;Not very much, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, you&rsquo;ll get used to it in time, Oliver,&rsquo; said Sowerberry. &lsquo;Nothing
      when you <i>are</i> used to it, my boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time to
      get Mr. Sowerberry used to it. But he thought it better not to ask the
      question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had seen and
      heard.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VI &mdash; OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO
      ACTION, AND RATHER ASTONISHES HIM
    </h2>
    <p>
      The month&rsquo;s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed. It was a nice
      sickly season just at this time. In commercial phrase, coffins were
      looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great
      deal of experience. The success of Mr. Sowerberry&rsquo;s ingenious speculation,
      exceeded even his most sanguine hopes. The oldest inhabitants recollected
      no period at which measles had been so prevalent, or so fatal to infant
      existence; and many were the mournful processions which little Oliver
      headed, in a hat-band reaching down to his knees, to the indescribable
      admiration and emotion of all the mothers in the town. As Oliver
      accompanied his master in most of his adult expeditions too, in order that
      he might acquire that equanimity of demeanour and full command of nerve
      which was essential to a finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of
      observing the beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some
      strong-minded people bear their trials and losses.
    </p>
    <p>
      For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich old
      lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews and
      nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous illness,
      and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most public
      occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need be&mdash;quite
      cheerful and contented&mdash;conversing together with as much freedom and
      gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb them. Husbands,
      too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic calmness. Wives,
      again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far from grieving in the
      garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to render it as becoming and
      attractive as possible. It was observable, too, that ladies and gentlemen
      who were in passions of anguish during the ceremony of interment,
      recovered almost as soon as they reached home, and became quite composed
      before the tea-drinking was over. All this was very pleasant and improving
      to see; and Oliver beheld it with great admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good
      people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm with
      any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for many
      months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and ill-treatment
      of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now that his
      jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the black stick and
      hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in the muffin-cap and
      leathers. Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah did; and Mrs. Sowerberry
      was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry was disposed to be his
      friend; so, between these three on one side, and a glut of funerals on the
      other, Oliver was not altogether as comfortable as the hungry pig was,
      when he was shut up, by mistake, in the grain department of a brewery.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver&rsquo;s history; for I
      have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance, but
      which indirectly produced a material change in all his future prospects
      and proceedings.
    </p>
    <p>
      One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual
      dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton&mdash;a pound and a
      half of the worst end of the neck&mdash;when Charlotte being called out of
      the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole, being
      hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a worthier
      purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the table-cloth;
      and pulled Oliver&rsquo;s hair; and twitched his ears; and expressed his opinion
      that he was a &lsquo;sneak&rsquo;; and furthermore announced his intention of coming
      to see him hanged, whenever that desirable event should take place; and
      entered upon various topics of petty annoyance, like a malicious and
      ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was. But, making Oliver cry, Noah
      attempted to be more facetious still; and in his attempt, did what many
      sometimes do to this day, when they want to be funny. He got rather
      personal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Work&rsquo;us,&rsquo; said Noah, &lsquo;how&rsquo;s your mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s dead,&rsquo; replied Oliver; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t you say anything about her to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver&rsquo;s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there was a
      curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole thought must
      be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying. Under this
      impression he returned to the charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did she die of, Work&rsquo;us?&rsquo; said Noah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,&rsquo; replied Oliver: more
      as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. &lsquo;I think I know
      what it must be to die of that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work&rsquo;us,&rsquo; said Noah, as a tear
      rolled down Oliver&rsquo;s cheek. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s set you a snivelling now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not <i>you</i>,&rsquo; replied Oliver, sharply. &lsquo;There; that&rsquo;s enough. Don&rsquo;t
      say anything more to me about her; you&rsquo;d better not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better not!&rsquo; exclaimed Noah. &lsquo;Well! Better not! Work&rsquo;us, don&rsquo;t be
      impudent. <i>Your</i> mother, too! She was a nice &lsquo;un she was. Oh, Lor!&rsquo; 
      And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of his
      small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the
      occasion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yer know, Work&rsquo;us,&rsquo; continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver&rsquo;s silence, and
      speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most
      annoying: &lsquo;Yer know, Work&rsquo;us, it can&rsquo;t be helped now; and of course yer
      couldn&rsquo;t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I&rsquo;m sure we all
      are, and pity yer very much. But yer must know, Work&rsquo;us, yer mother was a
      regular right-down bad &lsquo;un.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you say?&rsquo; inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A regular right-down bad &lsquo;un, Work&rsquo;us,&rsquo; replied Noah, coolly. &lsquo;And it&rsquo;s a
      great deal better, Work&rsquo;us, that she died when she did, or else she&rsquo;d have
      been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung; which is more
      likely than either, isn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table;
      seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till
      his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into one
      heavy blow, felled him to the ground.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0065.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected creature
      that harsh treatment had made him. But his spirit was roused at last; the
      cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire. His breast
      heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid; his whole person
      changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly tormentor who now lay
      crouching at his feet; and defied him with an energy he had never known
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll murder me!&rsquo; blubbered Noah. &lsquo;Charlotte! missis! Here&rsquo;s the new boy
      a murdering of me! Help! help! Oliver&rsquo;s gone mad! Char&mdash;lotte!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah&rsquo;s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a
      louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen by
      a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was quite
      certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human life, to
      come further down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you little wretch!&rsquo; screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her
      utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man in
      particularly good training. &lsquo;Oh, you little un-grate-ful, mur-de-rous,
      hor-rid villain!&rsquo; And between every syllable, Charlotte gave Oliver a blow
      with all her might: accompanying it with a scream, for the benefit of
      society.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte&rsquo;s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not be
      effectual in calming Oliver&rsquo;s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into the
      kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she scratched his
      face with the other. In this favourable position of affairs, Noah rose
      from the ground, and pommelled him behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was rather too violent exercise to last long. When they were all
      wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,
      struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and
      there locked him up. This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a chair,
      and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless her, she&rsquo;s going off!&rsquo; said Charlotte. &lsquo;A glass of water, Noah,
      dear. Make haste!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! Charlotte,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry: speaking as well as she could,
      through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which
      Noah had poured over her head and shoulders. &lsquo;Oh! Charlotte, what a mercy
      we have not all been murdered in our beds!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! mercy indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; was the reply. I only hope this&rsquo;ll teach master
      not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born to be
      murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah! He was all but
      killed, ma&rsquo;am, when I come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the charity-boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level with
      the crown of Oliver&rsquo;s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his wrists
      while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed some
      affecting tears and sniffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s to be done!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry. &lsquo;Your master&rsquo;s not at
      home; there&rsquo;s not a man in the house, and he&rsquo;ll kick that door down in ten
      minutes.&rsquo; Oliver&rsquo;s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in question,
      rendered this occurance highly probable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear! I don&rsquo;t know, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Charlotte, &lsquo;unless we send for the
      police-officers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Or the millingtary,&rsquo; suggested Mr. Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver&rsquo;s old friend.
      &lsquo;Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly, and not to
      lose a minute; never mind your cap! Make haste! You can hold a knife to
      that black eye, as you run along. It&rsquo;ll keep the swelling down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed; and
      very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a
      charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his
      head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII &mdash; OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not
      once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested here,
      for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an imposing show
      of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and presented such a
      rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that even he, who saw
      nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of times, started back in
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what&rsquo;s the matter with the boy!&rsquo; said the old pauper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bumble! Mr. Bumble!&rsquo; cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and in
      tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.
      Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much that
      he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,&mdash;which is a very
      curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle, acted
      upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a momentary
      visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of personal
      dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!&rsquo; said Noah: &lsquo;Oliver, sir,&mdash;Oliver has&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What? What?&rsquo; interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his
      metallic eyes. &lsquo;Not run away; he hasn&rsquo;t run away, has he, Noah?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir, no. Not run away, sir, but he&rsquo;s turned wicious,&rsquo; replied Noah.
      &lsquo;He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder Charlotte; and
      then missis. Oh! what dreadful pain it is!
    </p>
    <p>
      Such agony, please, sir!&rsquo; And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body into
      an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr. Bumble to
      understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of Oliver Twist, he
      had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from which he was at that
      moment suffering the acutest torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed
      Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his
      dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a
      gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in
      his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to
      attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman aforesaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman&rsquo;s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked
      three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young
      cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with something
      which would render the series of vocular exclamations so designated, an
      involuntary process?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble, &lsquo;who has
      been nearly murdered&mdash;all but murdered, sir,&mdash;by young Twist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By Jove!&rsquo; exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping short.
      &lsquo;I knew it! I felt a strange presentiment from the very first, that that
      audacious young savage would come to be hung!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And his missis,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?&rsquo; added Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! he&rsquo;s out, or he would have murdered him,&rsquo; replied Noah. &lsquo;He said he
      wanted to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?&rsquo; inquired the gentleman in the
      white waistcoat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied Noah. &lsquo;And please, sir, missis wants to know whether
      Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog him&mdash;&lsquo;cause
      master&rsquo;s out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, my boy; certainly,&rsquo; said the gentleman in the white waistcoat:
      smiling benignly, and patting Noah&rsquo;s head, which was about three inches
      higher than his own. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a good boy&mdash;a very good boy. Here&rsquo;s a
      penny for you. Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry&rsquo;s with your cane, and
      see what&rsquo;s best to be done. Don&rsquo;t spare him, Bumble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I will not, sir,&rsquo; replied the beadle. And the cocked hat and cane
      having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner&rsquo;s satisfaction, Mr.
      Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the
      undertaker&rsquo;s shop.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the position of affairs had not at all improved. Sowerberry had not
      yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished vigour, at
      the cellar-door. The accounts of his ferocity as related by Mrs.
      Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr. Bumble
      judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door. With this view he
      gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then, applying his
      mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oliver!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come; you let me out!&rsquo; replied Oliver, from the inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know this here voice, Oliver?&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ain&rsquo;t you afraid of it, sir? Ain&rsquo;t you a-trembling while I speak, sir?&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; replied Oliver, boldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was in
      the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little. He stepped back
      from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and looked from one
      to another of the three bystanders, in mute astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not Madness, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of deep
      meditation. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Meat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Meat, ma&rsquo;am, meat,&rsquo; replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve over-fed
      him, ma&rsquo;am. You&rsquo;ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in him, ma&rsquo;am
      unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs. Sowerberry, who
      are practical philosophers, will tell you. What have paupers to do with
      soul or spirit? It&rsquo;s quite enough that we let &lsquo;em have live bodies. If you
      had kept the boy on gruel, ma&rsquo;am, this would never have happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear, dear!&rsquo; ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to the
      kitchen ceiling: &lsquo;this comes of being liberal!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse
      bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else would
      eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in her
      voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s heavy accusation. Of which, to do
      her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or deed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth again;
      &lsquo;the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to leave him in
      the cellar for a day or so, till he&rsquo;s a little starved down; and then to
      take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the apprenticeship. He
      comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs. Sowerberry! Both the nurse
      and doctor said, that that mother of his made her way here, against
      difficulties and pain that would have killed any well-disposed woman,
      weeks before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point of Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to
      know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced kicking,
      with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible. Sowerberry
      returned at this juncture. Oliver&rsquo;s offence having been explained to him,
      with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best calculated to rouse his
      ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a twinkling, and dragged his
      rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver&rsquo;s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face
      was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead. The
      angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled out of
      his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite undismayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Sowerberry; giving
      Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He called my mother names,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Sowerberry. &lsquo;She deserved what he said, and worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She didn&rsquo;t&rsquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She did,&rsquo; said Mrs. Sowerberry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a lie!&rsquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative. If he had
      hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be quite
      clear to every experienced reader that he would have been, according to
      all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a brute, an unnatural
      husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of a man, and various
      other agreeable characters too numerous for recital within the limits of
      this chapter. To do him justice, he was, as far as his power went&mdash;it
      was not very extensive&mdash;kindly disposed towards the boy; perhaps,
      because it was his interest to be so; perhaps, because his wife disliked
      him. The flood of tears, however, left him no resource; so he at once gave
      him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs. Sowerberry herself, and rendered
      Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s subsequent application of the parochial cane, rather
      unnecessary. For the rest of the day, he was shut up in the back kitchen,
      in company with a pump and a slice of bread; and at night, Mrs.
      Sowerberry, after making various remarks outside the door, by no means
      complimentary to the memory of his mother, looked into the room, and,
      amidst the jeers and pointings of Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs
      to his dismal bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the
      gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings
      which the day&rsquo;s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a
      mere child. He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt; he
      had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in his
      heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they had
      roasted him alive. But now, when there were none to see or hear him, he
      fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his hands, wept
      such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few so young may
      ever have cause to pour out before him!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The candle
      was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having gazed
      cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the
      fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a cold, dark night. The stars seemed, to the boy&rsquo;s eyes, farther
      from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no wind; and
      the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground, looked sepulchral
      and death-like, from being so still. He softly reclosed the door. Having
      availed himself of the expiring light of the candle to tie up in a
      handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel he had, sat himself down
      upon a bench, to wait for morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the
      shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door. One timid look around&mdash;one
      moment&rsquo;s pause of hesitation&mdash;he had closed it behind him, and was in
      the open street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up the
      hill. He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across the
      fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the road;
      struck into it, and walked quickly on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside Mr.
      Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm. His way
      lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly when he
      bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back. He had come
      a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by doing so.
      Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of his being
      seen; so he walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      He reached the house. There was no appearance of its inmates stirring at
      that early hour. Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden. A child was
      weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his pale face and
      disclosed the features of one of his former companions. Oliver felt glad
      to see him, before he went; for, though younger than himself, he had been
      his little friend and playmate. They had been beaten, and starved, and
      shut up together, many and many a time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, Dick!&rsquo; said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his thin
      arm between the rails to greet him. &lsquo;Is any one up?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody but me,&rsquo; replied the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You musn&rsquo;t say you saw me, Dick,&rsquo; said Oliver. &lsquo;I am running away. They
      beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some long
      way off. I don&rsquo;t know where. How pale you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,&rsquo; replied the child with a faint
      smile. &lsquo;I am very glad to see you, dear; but don&rsquo;t stop, don&rsquo;t stop!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b&rsquo;ye to you,&rsquo; replied Oliver. &lsquo;I shall see
      you again, Dick. I know I shall! You will be well and happy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so,&rsquo; replied the child. &lsquo;After I am dead, but not before. I know
      the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of Heaven, and
      Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake. Kiss me,&rsquo; said
      the child, climbing up the low gate, and flinging his little arms round
      Oliver&rsquo;s neck. &lsquo;Good-b&rsquo;ye, dear! God bless you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The blessing was from a young child&rsquo;s lips, but it was the first that
      Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles and
      sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never once
      forgot it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VIII &mdash; OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON. HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A
      STRANGE SORT OF YOUNG GENTLEMAN
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more
      gained the high-road. It was eight o&rsquo;clock now. Though he was nearly five
      miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by turns,
      till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken. Then he sat
      down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think, for the
      first time, where he had better go and try to live.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an intimation
      that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The name awakened
      a new train of ideas in the boy&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      London!&mdash;that great place!&mdash;nobody&mdash;not even Mr. Bumble&mdash;could
      ever find him there! He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too,
      say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways of
      living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in country
      parts had no idea of. It was the very place for a homeless boy, who must
      die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these things passed
      through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again walked forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four
      miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could
      hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced
      itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his
      means of getting there. He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and two
      pairs of stockings, in his bundle. He had a penny too&mdash;a gift of
      Sowerberry&rsquo;s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more
      than ordinarily well&mdash;in his pocket. &lsquo;A clean shirt,&rsquo; thought Oliver,
      &lsquo;is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings;
      and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles&rsquo; walk in
      winter time.&rsquo; But Oliver&rsquo;s thoughts, like those of most other people,
      although they were extremely ready and active to point out his
      difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of
      surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular
      purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and
      trudged on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing but
      the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he begged at
      the cottage-doors by the road-side. When the night came, he turned into a
      meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined to lie there,
      till morning. He felt frightened at first, for the wind moaned dismally
      over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and more alone than he
      had ever felt before. Being very tired with his walk, however, he soon
      fell asleep and forgot his troubles.
    </p>
    <p>
      He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that he
      was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very first
      village through which he passed. He had walked no more than twelve miles,
      when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his legs so weak that
      they trembled beneath him. Another night passed in the bleak damp air,
      made him worse; when he set forward on his journey next morning he could
      hardly crawl along.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and
      then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took
      any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the
      top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a
      halfpenny. Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way, but
      was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet. When the
      outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets again,
      declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn&rsquo;t deserve anything; and
      the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust behind.
    </p>
    <p>
      In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all persons
      who begged within the district, that they would be sent to jail. This
      frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out of those
      villages with all possible expedition. In others, he would stand about the
      inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed: a proceeding which
      generally terminated in the landlady&rsquo;s ordering one of the post-boys who
      were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out of the place, for she
      was sure he had come to steal something. If he begged at a farmer&rsquo;s house,
      ten to one but they threatened to set the dog on him; and when he showed
      his nose in a shop, they talked about the beadle&mdash;which brought
      Oliver&rsquo;s heart into his mouth,&mdash;very often the only thing he had
      there, for many hours together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a
      benevolent old lady, Oliver&rsquo;s troubles would have been shortened by the
      very same process which had put an end to his mother&rsquo;s; in other words, he
      would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king&rsquo;s highway. But the
      turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady, who
      had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part of the
      earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little she could
      afford&mdash;and more&mdash;with such kind and gentle words, and such
      tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver&rsquo;s
      soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver
      limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were
      closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business of
      the day. The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the light only
      served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation, as he sat,
      with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.
    </p>
    <p>
      By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up; and
      people began passing to and fro. Some few stopped to gaze at Oliver for a
      moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they hurried by; but
      none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire how he came there. He
      had no heart to beg. And there he sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great
      number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern, large
      or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed through, and
      thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with ease, in a few
      hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and determination
      beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by observing that a
      boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes before, had returned, and
      was now surveying him most earnestly from the opposite side of the way. He
      took little heed of this at first; but the boy remained in the same
      attitude of close observation so long, that Oliver raised his head, and
      returned his steady look. Upon this, the boy crossed over; and walking
      close up to Oliver, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo, my covey! What&rsquo;s the row?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his
      own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even seen.
      He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and as dirty a
      juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all the airs and
      manners of a man. He was short of his age: with rather bow-legs, and
      little, sharp, ugly eyes. His hat was stuck on the top of his head so
      lightly, that it threatened to fall off every moment&mdash;and would have
      done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a knack of every now and
      then giving his head a sudden twitch, which brought it back to its old
      place again. He wore a man&rsquo;s coat, which reached nearly to his heels. He
      had turned the cuffs back, half-way up his arm, to get his hands out of
      the sleeves: apparently with the ultimate view of thrusting them into the
      pockets of his corduroy trousers; for there he kept them. He was,
      altogether, as roystering and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood
      four feet six, or something less, in the bluchers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hullo, my covey! What&rsquo;s the row?&rsquo; said this strange young gentleman to
      Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very hungry and tired,&rsquo; replied Oliver: the tears standing in his
      eyes as he spoke. &lsquo;I have walked a long way. I have been walking these
      seven days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walking for sivin days!&rsquo; said the young gentleman. &lsquo;Oh, I see. Beak&rsquo;s
      order, eh? But,&rsquo; he added, noticing Oliver&rsquo;s look of surprise, &lsquo;I suppose
      you don&rsquo;t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird&rsquo;s mouth described
      by the term in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My eyes, how green!&rsquo; exclaimed the young gentleman. &lsquo;Why, a beak&rsquo;s a
      madgst&rsquo;rate; and when you walk by a beak&rsquo;s order, it&rsquo;s not straight
      for&rsquo;erd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin. Was you never
      on the mill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What mill?&rsquo; inquired Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What mill! Why, <i>the</i> mill&mdash;the mill as takes up so little room
      that it&rsquo;ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind&rsquo;s
      low with people, than when it&rsquo;s high; acos then they can&rsquo;t get workmen.
      But come,&rsquo; said the young gentleman; &lsquo;you want grub, and you shall have
      it. I&rsquo;m at low-water-mark myself&mdash;only one bob and a magpie; but, as
      far as it goes, I&rsquo;ll fork out and stump. Up with you on your pins. There!
      Now then! &lsquo;Morrice!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent
      chandler&rsquo;s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham and
      a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, &lsquo;a fourpenny bran!&rsquo; 
      the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the ingenious
      expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a portion of the
      crumb, and stuffing it therein. Taking the bread under his arm, the young
      gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led the way to a tap-room
      in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer was brought in, by
      direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver, falling to, at his new
      friend&rsquo;s bidding, made a long and hearty meal, during the progress of
      which the strange boy eyed him from time to time with great attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going to London?&rsquo; said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length
      concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Got any lodgings?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Money?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as the
      big coat-sleeves would let them go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you live in London?&rsquo; inquired Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I do, when I&rsquo;m at home,&rsquo; replied the boy. &lsquo;I suppose you want some
      place to sleep in to-night, don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do, indeed,&rsquo; answered Oliver. &lsquo;I have not slept under a roof since I
      left the country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fret your eyelids on that score,&rsquo; said the young gentleman. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve
      got to be in London to-night; and I know a &lsquo;spectable old gentleman as
      lives there, wot&rsquo;ll give you lodgings for nothink, and never ask for the
      change&mdash;that is, if any genelman he knows interduces you. And don&rsquo;t
      he know me? Oh, no! Not in the least! By no means. Certainly not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments of
      discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;
      especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the
      old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a
      comfortable place, without loss of time. This led to a more friendly and
      confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his friend&rsquo;s name
      was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and protege of the
      elderly gentleman before mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dawkin&rsquo;s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the comforts
      which his patron&rsquo;s interest obtained for those whom he took under his
      protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute mode of
      conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate friends he was
      better known by the sobriquet of &lsquo;The Artful Dodger,&rsquo; Oliver concluded
      that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the moral precepts of his
      benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon him. Under this impression,
      he secretly resolved to cultivate the good opinion of the old gentleman as
      quickly as possible; and, if he found the Dodger incorrigible, as he more
      than half suspected he should, to decline the honour of his farther
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it was
      nearly eleven o&rsquo;clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington. They
      crossed from the Angel into St. John&rsquo;s Road; struck down the small street
      which terminates at Sadler&rsquo;s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth Street and
      Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the workhouse; across
      the classic ground which once bore the name of Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence
      into Little Saffron Hill; and so into Saffron Hill the Great: along which
      the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace, directing Oliver to follow close at
      his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of his
      leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either side of
      the way, as he passed along. A dirtier or more wretched place he had never
      seen. The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air was impregnated
      with filthy odours.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade appeared
      to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were crawling in
      and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside. The sole places that
      seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the place, were the
      public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish were wrangling with
      might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here and there diverged from
      the main street, disclosed little knots of houses, where drunken men and
      women were positively wallowing in filth; and from several of the
      door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were cautiously emerging, bound, to
      all appearance, on no very well-disposed or harmless errands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was just considering whether he hadn&rsquo;t better run away, when they
      reached the bottom of the hill. His conductor, catching him by the arm,
      pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing him into the
      passage, closed it behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then!&rsquo; cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the
      Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Plummy and slam!&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the
      light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the
      passage; and a man&rsquo;s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the old
      kitchen staircase had been broken away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s two on you,&rsquo; said the man, thrusting the candle farther out, and
      shielding his eyes with his hand. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s the t&rsquo;other one?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A new pal,&rsquo; replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where did he come from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he&rsquo;s a sortin&rsquo; the wipes. Up with you!&rsquo; The candle was drawn back,
      and the face disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly grasped
      by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and broken
      stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition that
      showed he was well acquainted with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      He threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and dirt.
      There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a candle, stuck in
      a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf and butter, and a
      plate. In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and which was secured to
      the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were cooking; and standing over
      them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was a very old shrivelled Jew,
      whose villainous-looking and repulsive face was obscured by a quantity of
      matted red hair. He was dressed in a greasy flannel gown, with his throat
      bare; and seemed to be dividing his attention between the frying-pan and
      the clothes-horse, over which a great number of silk handkerchiefs were
      hanging. Several rough beds made of old sacks, were huddled side by side
      on the floor. Seated round the table were four or five boys, none older
      than the Dodger, smoking long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the
      air of middle-aged men. These all crowded about their associate as he
      whispered a few words to the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at
      Oliver. So did the Jew himself, toasting-fork in hand.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0073.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is him, Fagin,&rsquo; said Jack Dawkins; &lsquo;my friend Oliver Twist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the
      hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.
      Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook
      both his hands very hard&mdash;especially the one in which he held his
      little bundle. One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap for
      him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his pockets, in
      order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the trouble of
      emptying them, himself, when he went to bed. These civilities would
      probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal exercise of the Jew&rsquo;s
      toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the affectionate youths who
      offered them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,&rsquo; said the Jew. &lsquo;Dodger, take
      off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver. Ah, you&rsquo;re
      a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a good many
      of &lsquo;em, ain&rsquo;t there? We&rsquo;ve just looked &lsquo;em out, ready for the wash; that&rsquo;s
      all, Oliver; that&rsquo;s all. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from all
      the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of which they
      went to supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot
      gin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because another
      gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired. Immediately
      afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the sacks; and then
      he sunk into a deep sleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX &mdash; CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT
      OLD GENTLEMAN, AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.
      There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling
      some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to himself
      as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would stop every
      now and then to listen when there was the least noise below: and when he
      had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and stirring again, as
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly
      awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you
      dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half
      conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in five
      nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in perfect
      unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of what his mind
      is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its mighty powers, its
      bounding from earth and spurning time and space, when freed from the
      restraint of its corporeal associate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his
      half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of the
      spoon grating against the saucepan&rsquo;s sides: and yet the self-same senses
      were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with almost
      everybody he had ever known.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob. Standing,
      then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he did not well
      know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at Oliver, and
      called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all appearances
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the
      door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver, from
      some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on the
      table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in. Dragging an
      old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a magnificent gold
      watch, sparkling with jewels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every
      feature with a hideous grin. &lsquo;Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the
      last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old
      Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn&rsquo;t have loosened the knot, or kept
      the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew
      once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a
      dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed with
      equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other articles of
      jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly workmanship, that
      Oliver had no idea, even of their names.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that it
      lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute
      inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading it
      with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put it
      down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair,
      muttered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead men
      never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it&rsquo;s a fine thing for the trade!
      Five of &lsquo;em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or turn
      white-livered!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been
      staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver&rsquo;s face; the boy&rsquo;s eyes were
      fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only for
      an instant&mdash;for the briefest space of time that can possibly be
      conceived&mdash;it was enough to show the old man that he had been
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on a
      bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled very
      much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the knife
      quivered in the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; said the Jew. &lsquo;What do you watch me for? Why are you awake?
      What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick&mdash;quick! for your life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t able to sleep any longer, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver, meekly. &lsquo;I am
      very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were not awake an hour ago?&rsquo; said the Jew, scowling fiercely on the
      boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! No, indeed!&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you sure?&rsquo; cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before: and
      a threatening attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word I was not, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver, earnestly. &lsquo;I was not,
      indeed, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tush, tush, my dear!&rsquo; said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner, and
      playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to induce
      the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. &lsquo;Of course I know
      that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You&rsquo;re a brave boy. Ha! ha!
      you&rsquo;re a brave boy, Oliver.&rsquo; The Jew rubbed his hands with a chuckle, but
      glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?&rsquo; said the Jew, laying
      his hand upon it after a short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the Jew, turning rather pale. &lsquo;They&mdash;they&rsquo;re mine, Oliver;
      my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks call
      me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in such a
      dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps his fondness
      for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of money, he only
      cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he might get up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, my dear, certainly,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman. &lsquo;Stay. There&rsquo;s
      a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here; and I&rsquo;ll give
      you a basin to wash in, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to raise
      the pitcher. When he turned his head, the box was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying the
      basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew&rsquo;s directions, when the
      Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom Oliver
      had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally
      introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on
      the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought home
      in the crown of his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself to
      the Dodger, &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ve been at work this morning, my dears?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hard,&rsquo; replied the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As nails,&rsquo; added Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good boys, good boys!&rsquo; said the Jew. &lsquo;What have you got, Dodger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A couple of pocket-books,&rsquo; replied that young gentlman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lined?&rsquo; inquired the Jew, with eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well,&rsquo; replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one green,
      and the other red.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so heavy as they might be,&rsquo; said the Jew, after looking at the
      insides carefully; &lsquo;but very neat and nicely made. Ingenious workman,
      ain&rsquo;t he, Oliver?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very indeed, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed
      uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to
      laugh at, in anything that had passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what have you got, my dear?&rsquo; said Fagin to Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wipes,&rsquo; replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four
      pocket-handkerchiefs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the Jew, inspecting them closely; &lsquo;they&rsquo;re very good ones,
      very. You haven&rsquo;t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall be
      picked out with a needle, and we&rsquo;ll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall us,
      Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley
      Bates, wouldn&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rsquo; said the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much, indeed, if you&rsquo;ll teach me, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that he
      burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was drinking,
      and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly terminated in his
      premature suffocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is so jolly green!&rsquo; said Charley when he recovered, as an apology to
      the company for his unpolite behaviour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver&rsquo;s hair over his eyes, and
      said he&rsquo;d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman, observing
      Oliver&rsquo;s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking whether there had
      been much of a crowd at the execution that morning? This made him wonder
      more and more; for it was plain from the replies of the two boys that they
      had both been there; and Oliver naturally wondered how they could possibly
      have found time to be so very industrious.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two
      boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in
      this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of
      his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat
      pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond pin
      in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his
      spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the
      room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen walk
      about the streets any hour in the day. Sometimes he stopped at the
      fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was staring
      with all his might into shop-windows. At such times, he would look
      constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping all his
      pockets in turn, to see that he hadn&rsquo;t lost anything, in such a very funny
      and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran down his face.
      All this time, the two boys followed him closely about: getting out of his
      sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that it was impossible to
      follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod upon his toes, or ran upon
      his boot accidently, while Charley Bates stumbled up against him behind;
      and in that one moment they took from him, with the most extraordinary
      rapidity, snuff-box, note-case, watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin,
      pocket-handkerchief, even the spectacle-case. If the old gentlman felt a
      hand in any one of his pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the
      game began all over again.
    </p>
    <p>
      When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young
      ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet, and
      the other Nancy. They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly turned up
      behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings. They were
      not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of colour in their
      faces, and looked quite stout and hearty. Being remarkably free and
      agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them very nice girls indeed. As
      there is no doubt they were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence of
      one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and the
      conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length, Charley
      Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof. This, it
      occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly afterwards,
      the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went away together,
      having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with money to spend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, my dear,&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a pleasant life, isn&rsquo;t it? They have
      gone out for the day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have they done work, sir?&rsquo; inquired Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Jew; &lsquo;that is, unless they should unexpectedly come across
      any, when they are out; and they won&rsquo;t neglect it, if they do, my dear,
      depend upon it. Make &lsquo;em your models, my dear. Make &lsquo;em your models,&rsquo; 
      tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his words; &lsquo;do
      everything they bid you, and take their advice in all matters&mdash;especially
      the Dodger&rsquo;s, my dear. He&rsquo;ll be a great man himself, and will make you one
      too, if you take pattern by him.&mdash;Is my handkerchief hanging out of
      my pocket, my dear?&rsquo; said the Jew, stopping short.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do,
      when we were at play this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen the
      Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it gone?&rsquo; cried the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here it is, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver, showing it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a clever boy, my dear,&rsquo; said the playful old gentleman, patting
      Oliver on the head approvingly. &lsquo;I never saw a sharper lad. Here&rsquo;s a
      shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you&rsquo;ll be the greatest man of
      the time. And now come here, and I&rsquo;ll show you how to take the marks out
      of the handkerchiefs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman&rsquo;s pocket in play, had to do
      with his chances of being a great man. But, thinking that the Jew, being
      so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to the table,
      and was soon deeply involved in his new study.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X &mdash; OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF
      HIS NEW ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A
      SHORT, BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew&rsquo;s room, picking the marks out of
      the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought home,) and
      sometimes taking part in the game already described: which the two boys
      and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length, he began to
      languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of earnestly entreating
      the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work with his two companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what he
      had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman&rsquo;s character. Whenever
      the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed, he would
      expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy habits; and
      would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by sending them
      supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went so far as to
      knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was carrying out his
      virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so eagerly
      sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two or three
      days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these were reasons
      for the old gentleman&rsquo;s giving his assent; but, whether they were or no,
      he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the joint guardianship of
      Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,
      and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his hands
      in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they were going,
      and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in, first.
    </p>
    <p>
      The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter,
      that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive the
      old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a vicious
      propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small boys and
      tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some very loose
      notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering divers apples and
      onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and thrusting them into
      pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that they seemed to
      undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction. These things
      looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring his intention of
      seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when his thoughts were
      suddenly directed into another channel, by a very mysterious change of
      behaviour on the part of the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open square
      in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion of terms,
      &lsquo;The Green&rsquo;: when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying his finger on
      his lip, drew his companions back again, with the greatest caution and
      circumspection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; demanded Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; replied the Dodger. &lsquo;Do you see that old cove at the book-stall?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The old gentleman over the way?&rsquo; said Oliver. &lsquo;Yes, I see him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll do,&rsquo; said the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A prime plant,&rsquo; observed Master Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he
      was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked
      stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman
      towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces
      after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood looking
      on in silent amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a
      powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green coat
      with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a smart
      bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall, and
      there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his elbow-chair, in
      his own study. It is very possible that he fancied himself there, indeed;
      for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he saw not the book-stall,
      nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short, anything but the book itself:
      which he was reading straight through: turning over the leaf when he got
      to the bottom of a page, beginning at the top line of the next one, and
      going regularly on, with the greatest interest and eagerness.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0081.jpg" alt="0081" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0081.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      What was Oliver&rsquo;s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking on
      with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the Dodger
      plunge his hand into the old gentleman&rsquo;s pocket, and draw from thence a
      handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and finally to
      behold them, both running away round the corner at full speed!
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches, and
      the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy&rsquo;s mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his veins
      from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then, confused
      and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made
      off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all done in a minute&rsquo;s space. In the very instant when Oliver
      began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and
      missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding away
      at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the
      depredator; and shouting &lsquo;Stop thief!&rsquo; with all his might, made off after
      him, book in hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the hue-and-cry.
      The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public attention by
      running down the open street, had merely retired into the very first
      doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and saw Oliver
      running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they issued forth
      with great promptitude; and, shouting &lsquo;Stop thief!&rsquo; too, joined in the
      pursuit like good citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not
      theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that self-preservation
      is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps he would have been
      prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it alarmed him the more;
      so away he went like the wind, with the old gentleman and the two boys
      roaring and shouting behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rsquo; There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman
      leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down
      his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy his
      parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the child
      his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter, slap-dash:
      tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as they turn the
      corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls: and streets,
      squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rsquo; The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and the
      crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through the
      mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run the
      people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the very
      thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the shout,
      and lend fresh vigour to the cry, &lsquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop thief! Stop thief!&rsquo; There is a passion for <i>hunting</i> <i>something</i>
      deeply implanted in the human breast. One wretched breathless child,
      panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large
      drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to make
      head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain upon him
      every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy. &lsquo;Stop thief!&rsquo; 
      Ay, stop him for God&rsquo;s sake, were it only in mercy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Stopped at last! A clever blow. He is down upon the pavement; and the
      crowd eagerly gather round him: each new comer, jostling and struggling
      with the others to catch a glimpse. &lsquo;Stand aside!&rsquo; &lsquo;Give him a little
      air!&rsquo; &lsquo;Nonsense! he don&rsquo;t deserve it.&rsquo; &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the gentleman?&rsquo; &lsquo;Here his
      is, coming down the street.&rsquo; &lsquo;Make room there for the gentleman!&rsquo; &lsquo;Is this
      the boy, sir!&rsquo; &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,
      looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when the
      old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by the
      foremost of the pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;I am afraid it is the boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Afraid!&rsquo; murmured the crowd. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a good &lsquo;un!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; said the gentleman, &lsquo;he has hurt himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> did that, sir,&rsquo; said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward;
      &lsquo;and preciously I cut my knuckle agin&rsquo; his mouth. I stopped him, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his pains;
      but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of dislike, look
      anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away himself: which it is
      very possible he might have attempted to do, and thus have afforded
      another chase, had not a police officer (who is generally the last person
      to arrive in such cases) at that moment made his way through the crowd,
      and seized Oliver by the collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, get up,&rsquo; said the man, roughly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t me indeed, sir. Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,&rsquo; said
      Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round. &lsquo;They are here
      somewhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, they ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said the officer. He meant this to be ironical, but
      it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off down
      the first convenient court they came to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, get up!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t hurt him,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, compassionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, I won&rsquo;t hurt him,&rsquo; replied the officer, tearing his jacket half
      off his back, in proof thereof. &lsquo;Come, I know you; it won&rsquo;t do. Will you
      stand upon your legs, you young devil?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his feet,
      and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at a rapid
      pace. The gentleman walked on with them by the officer&rsquo;s side; and as many
      of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead, and stared
      back at Oliver from time to time. The boys shouted in triumph; and on they
      went.

    <p>
      The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the
      immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.
      The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two or
      three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led
      beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of
      summary justice, by the back way. It was a small paved yard into which
      they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of
      whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rsquo; said the man carelessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A young fogle-hunter,&rsquo; replied the man who had Oliver in charge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you the party that&rsquo;s been robbed, sir?&rsquo; inquired the man with the
      keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman; &lsquo;but I am not sure that this boy
      actually took the handkerchief. I&mdash;I would rather not press the
      case.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Must go before the magistrate now, sir,&rsquo; replied the man. &lsquo;His worship
      will be disengaged in half a minute. Now, young gallows!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he
      unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell. Here he was
      searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not so
      light. It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning; and it
      had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up,
      elsewhere, since Saturday night. But this is little. In our
      station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most trivial
      charges&mdash;the word is worth noting&mdash;in dungeons, compared with
      which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried,
      found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who
      doubts this, compare the two.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated in
      the lock. He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the innocent
      cause of all this disturbance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something in that boy&rsquo;s face,&rsquo; said the old gentleman to himself
      as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of the book, in
      a thoughtful manner; &lsquo;something that touches and interests me. <i>Can</i>
      he be innocent? He looked like&mdash;Bye the bye,&rsquo; exclaimed the old
      gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky, &lsquo;Bless my
      soul!&mdash;where have I seen something like that look before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same
      meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there,
      retiring into a corner, called up before his mind&rsquo;s eye a vast
      amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many years.
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, shaking his head; &lsquo;it must be imagination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered over them again. He had called them into view, and it was not
      easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them. There were the
      faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost strangers
      peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of young and
      blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that the grave
      had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to its power,
      still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling back the lustre
      of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming of the soul through
      its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond the tomb, changed but to
      be heightened, and taken from earth only to be set up as a light, to shed
      a soft and gentle glow upon the path to Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver&rsquo;s
      features bore a trace. So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he
      awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman, buried
      them again in the pages of the musty book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man with
      the keys to follow him into the office. He closed his book hastily; and
      was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the renowned Mr. Fang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall. Mr. Fang sat behind
      a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of wooden pen
      in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling very much at
      the awfulness of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with no
      great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and sides of
      his head. His face was stern, and much flushed. If he were really not in
      the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good for him, he might
      have brought action against his countenance for libel, and have recovered
      heavy damages.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate&rsquo;s
      desk, said, suiting the action to the word, &lsquo;That is my name and address,
      sir.&rsquo; He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another polite and
      gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading
      article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent decision
      of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth time, to
      the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State for the Home
      Department. He was out of temper; and he looked up with an angry scowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who are you?&rsquo; said Mr. Fang.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Officer!&rsquo; said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the
      newspaper. &lsquo;Who is this fellow?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name, sir,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, speaking <i>like</i> a gentleman,
      &lsquo;my name, sir, is Brownlow. Permit me to inquire the name of the
      magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a respectable
      person, under the protection of the bench.&rsquo; Saying this, Mr. Brownlow
      looked around the office as if in search of some person who would afford
      him the required information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Officer!&rsquo; said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s this
      fellow charged with?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s not charged at all, your worship,&rsquo; replied the officer. &lsquo;He appears
      against this boy, your worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and a
      safe one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Appears against the boy, does he?&rsquo; said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr. Brownlow
      contemptuously from head to foot. &lsquo;Swear him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;and
      that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could have
      believed&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, sir!&rsquo; said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not, sir!&rsquo; replied the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue this instant, or I&rsquo;ll have you turned out of the
      office!&rsquo; said Mr. Fang. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re an insolent impertinent fellow. How dare
      you bully a magistrate!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swear this person!&rsquo; said Fang to the clerk. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not hear another word.
      Swear him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps,
      that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed his
      feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Fang, &lsquo;what&rsquo;s the charge against this boy? What have you got
      to say, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was standing at a bookstall&mdash;&rsquo; Mr. Brownlow began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Fang. &lsquo;Policeman! Where&rsquo;s the policeman?
      Here, swear this policeman. Now, policeman, what is this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the
      charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person; and
      how that was all he knew about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are there any witnesses?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Fang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None, your worship,&rsquo; replied the policeman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the
      prosecutor, said in a towering passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or do
      you not? You have been sworn. Now, if you stand there, refusing to give
      evidence, I&rsquo;ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will, by&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed very
      loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy book upon
      the floor, thus preventing the word from being heard&mdash;accidently, of
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived to
      state his case; observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he had run
      after the boy because he had saw him running away; and expressing his hope
      that, if the magistrate should believe him, although not actually the
      thief, to be connected with the thieves, he would deal as leniently with
      him as justice would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has been hurt already,&rsquo; said the old gentleman in conclusion. &lsquo;And I
      fear,&rsquo; he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, &lsquo;I really
      fear that he is ill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! yes, I dare say!&rsquo; said Mr. Fang, with a sneer. &lsquo;Come, none of your
      tricks here, you young vagabond; they won&rsquo;t do. What&rsquo;s your name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him. He was deadly pale; and
      the whole place seemed turning round and round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s your name, you hardened scoundrel?&rsquo; demanded Mr. Fang. &lsquo;Officer,
      what&rsquo;s his name?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who was
      standing by the bar. He bent over Oliver, and repeated the inquiry; but
      finding him really incapable of understanding the question; and knowing
      that his not replying would only infuriate the magistrate the more, and
      add to the severity of his sentence; he hazarded a guess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He says his name&rsquo;s Tom White, your worship,&rsquo; said the kind-hearted
      thief-taker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, he won&rsquo;t speak out, won&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; said Fang. &lsquo;Very well, very well.
      Where does he live?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where he can, your worship,&rsquo; replied the officer; again pretending to
      receive Oliver&rsquo;s answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he any parents?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Fang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He says they died in his infancy, your worship,&rsquo; replied the officer:
      hazarding the usual reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking round
      with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stuff and nonsense!&rsquo; said Mr. Fang: &lsquo;don&rsquo;t try to make a fool of me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think he really is ill, your worship,&rsquo; remonstrated the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know better,&rsquo; said Mr. Fang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care of him, officer,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, raising his hands
      instinctively; &lsquo;he&rsquo;ll fall down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand away, officer,&rsquo; cried Fang; &lsquo;let him, if he likes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in a
      fainting fit. The men in the office looked at each other, but no one dared
      to stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew he was shamming,&rsquo; said Fang, as if this were incontestable proof
      of the fact. &lsquo;Let him lie there; he&rsquo;ll soon be tired of that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?&rsquo; inquired the clerk in a
      low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Summarily,&rsquo; replied Mr. Fang. &lsquo;He stands committed for three months&mdash;hard
      labour of course. Clear the office.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were preparing
      to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man of decent but
      poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed hastily into the
      office, and advanced towards the bench.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, stop! don&rsquo;t take him away! For Heaven&rsquo;s sake stop a moment!&rsquo; cried
      the new comer, breathless with haste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a summary
      and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the character,
      almost the lives, of Her Majesty&rsquo;s subjects, expecially of the poorer
      class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic tricks are daily
      played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are closed to the
      public, save through the medium of the daily press.[Footnote: Or were
      virtually, then.] Mr. Fang was consequently not a little indignant to see
      an unbidden guest enter in such irreverent disorder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this? Who is this? Turn this man out. Clear the office!&rsquo; cried
      Mr. Fang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>will</i> speak,&rsquo; cried the man; &lsquo;I will not be turned out. I saw it
      all. I keep the book-stall. I demand to be sworn. I will not be put down.
      Mr. Fang, you must hear me. You must not refuse, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man was right. His manner was determined; and the matter was growing
      rather too serious to be hushed up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Swear the man,&rsquo; growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. &lsquo;Now, man, what
      have you got to say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the man: &lsquo;I saw three boys: two others and the prisoner here:
      loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman was
      reading. The robbery was committed by another boy. I saw it done; and I
      saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.&rsquo; Having by
      this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall keeper
      proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact circumstances of
      the robbery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come here before?&rsquo; said Fang, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hadn&rsquo;t a soul to mind the shop,&rsquo; replied the man. &lsquo;Everybody who could
      have helped me, had joined in the pursuit. I could get nobody till five
      minutes ago; and I&rsquo;ve run here all the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The prosecutor was reading, was he?&rsquo; inquired Fang, after another pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the man. &lsquo;The very book he has in his hand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that book, eh?&rsquo; said Fang. &lsquo;Is it paid for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it is not,&rsquo; replied the man, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, I forgot all about it!&rsquo; exclaimed the absent old gentleman,
      innocently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!&rsquo; said Fang, with a
      comical effort to look humane. &lsquo;I consider, sir, that you have obtained
      possession of that book, under very suspicious and disreputable
      circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate that the owner of
      the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a lesson to you, my man,
      or the law will overtake you yet. The boy is discharged. Clear the
      office!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;D&mdash;n me!&rsquo; cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had
      kept down so long, &lsquo;d&mdash;n me! I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clear the office!&rsquo; said the magistrate. &lsquo;Officers, do you hear? Clear the
      office!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed out,
      with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other: in a perfect
      phrenzy of rage and defiance. He reached the yard; and his passion
      vanished in a moment. Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on the pavement,
      with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with water; his face a
      deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor boy, poor boy!&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. &lsquo;Call a coach,
      somebody, pray. Directly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the seat,
      the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I accompany you?&rsquo; said the book-stall keeper, looking in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless me, yes, my dear sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow quickly. &lsquo;I forgot you.
      Dear, dear! I have this unhappy book still! Jump in. Poor fellow! There&rsquo;s
      no time to lose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII &mdash; IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER
      WAS BEFORE. AND IN WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN
      AND HIS YOUTHFUL FRIENDS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which Oliver
      had traversed when he first entered London in company with the Dodger;
      and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at Islington,
      stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady street near
      Pentonville. Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of time, in which Mr.
      Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and comfortably deposited; and
      here, he was tended with a kindness and solicitude that knew no bounds.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of his
      new friends. The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and many
      times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy bed,
      dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever. The worm does
      not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow creeping fire
      upon the living frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have been
      a long and troubled dream. Feebly raising himself in the bed, with his
      head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What room is this? Where have I been brought to?&rsquo; said Oliver. &lsquo;This is
      not the place I went to sleep in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak; but
      they were overheard at once. The curtain at the bed&rsquo;s head was hastily
      drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely dressed,
      rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which she had been
      sitting at needle-work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, my dear,&rsquo; said the old lady softly. &lsquo;You must be very quiet, or you
      will be ill again; and you have been very bad,&mdash;as bad as bad could
      be, pretty nigh. Lie down again; there&rsquo;s a dear!&rsquo; With those words, the
      old lady very gently placed Oliver&rsquo;s head upon the pillow; and, smoothing
      back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving in his face,
      that he could not help placing his little withered hand in hers, and
      drawing it round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Save us!&rsquo; said the old lady, with tears in her eyes. &lsquo;What a grateful
      little dear it is. Pretty creetur! What would his mother feel if she had
      sat by him as I have, and could see him now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps she does see me,&rsquo; whispered Oliver, folding his hands together;
      &lsquo;perhaps she has sat by me. I almost feel as if she had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was the fever, my dear,&rsquo; said the old lady mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose it was,&rsquo; replied Oliver, &lsquo;because heaven is a long way off; and
      they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor boy. But
      if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there; for she was
      very ill herself before she died. She can&rsquo;t know anything about me
      though,&rsquo; added Oliver after a moment&rsquo;s silence. &lsquo;If she had seen me hurt,
      it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always looked sweet and
      happy, when I have dreamed of her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her
      spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were part
      and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver to drink;
      and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very quiet, or he
      would be ill again.
    </p>
    <p>
      So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the kind
      old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he was
      completely exhausted with what he had already said. He soon fell into a
      gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a candle: which,
      being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with a very large and
      loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his pulse, and said he was a
      great deal better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>are</i> a great deal better, are you not, my dear?&rsquo; said the
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, thank you, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I know you are,&rsquo; said the gentleman: &lsquo;You&rsquo;re hungry too, an&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; answered Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;No, I know you&rsquo;re not. He is not hungry, Mrs.
      Bedwin,&rsquo; said the gentleman: looking very wise.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to
      say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor appeared
      much of the same opinion himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You feel sleepy, don&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rsquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re not
      sleepy. Nor thirsty. Are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir, rather thirsty,&rsquo; answered Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very natural
      that he should be thirsty. You may give him a little tea, ma&rsquo;am, and some
      dry toast without any butter. Don&rsquo;t keep him too warm, ma&rsquo;am; but be
      careful that you don&rsquo;t let him be too cold; will you have the goodness?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady dropped a curtsey. The doctor, after tasting the cool stuff,
      and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away: his boots
      creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly
      twelve o&rsquo;clock. The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly
      afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just come:
      bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a large
      nightcap. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the table, the
      old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up with him, drew
      her chair close to the fire and went off into a series of short naps,
      chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings forward, and divers
      moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse effect than causing her
      to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      And thus the night crept slowly on. Oliver lay awake for some time,
      counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the
      rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid eyes
      the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and the deep
      stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into the boy&rsquo;s
      mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many days and
      nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his awful
      presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently prayed to
      Heaven.
    </p>
    <p>
      Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent
      suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain to
      wake from. Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all the
      struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present; its
      anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of the
      past!
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt
      cheerful and happy. The crisis of the disease was safely past. He belonged
      to the world again.
    </p>
    <p>
      In three days&rsquo; time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped up
      with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had him
      carried downstairs into the little housekeeper&rsquo;s room, which belonged to
      her. Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old lady sat herself
      down too; and, being in a state of considerable delight at seeing him so
      much better, forthwith began to cry most violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind me, my dear,&rsquo; said the old lady; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m only having a regular
      good cry. There; it&rsquo;s all over now; and I&rsquo;m quite comfortable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re very, very kind to me, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, never you mind that, my dear,&rsquo; said the old lady; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s got
      nothing to do with your broth; and it&rsquo;s full time you had it; for the
      doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we must
      get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he&rsquo;ll be
      pleased.&rsquo; And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming up, in a
      little saucepan, a basin full of broth: strong enough, Oliver thought, to
      furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation strength, for
      three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest computation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you fond of pictures, dear?&rsquo; inquired the old lady, seeing that
      Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung against
      the wall; just opposite his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t quite know, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Oliver, without taking his eyes from the
      canvas; &lsquo;I have seen so few that I hardly know. What a beautiful, mild
      face that lady&rsquo;s is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the old lady, &lsquo;painters always make ladies out prettier than
      they are, or they wouldn&rsquo;t get any custom, child. The man that invented
      the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never
      succeed; it&rsquo;s a deal too honest. A deal,&rsquo; said the old lady, laughing very
      heartily at her own acuteness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is&mdash;is that a likeness, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      a portrait.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whose, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; asked Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, really, my dear, I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; answered the old lady in a
      good-humoured manner. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a likeness of anybody that you or I know,
      I expect. It seems to strike your fancy, dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is so pretty,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, sure you&rsquo;re not afraid of it?&rsquo; said the old lady: observing in great
      surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, no,&rsquo; returned Oliver quickly; &lsquo;but the eyes look so sorrowful; and
      where I sit, they seem fixed upon me. It makes my heart beat,&rsquo; added
      Oliver in a low voice, &lsquo;as if it was alive, and wanted to speak to me, but
      couldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord save us!&rsquo; exclaimed the old lady, starting; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t talk in that way,
      child. You&rsquo;re weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel your chair
      round to the other side; and then you won&rsquo;t see it. There!&rsquo; said the old
      lady, suiting the action to the word; &lsquo;you don&rsquo;t see it now, at all
      events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver <i>did</i> see it in his mind&rsquo;s eye as distinctly as if he had not
      altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind old
      lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin,
      satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of toasted
      bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a
      preparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition. He had
      scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at the
      door. &lsquo;Come in,&rsquo; said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no sooner
      raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands behind the
      skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at Oliver, than his
      countenance underwent a very great variety of odd contortions. Oliver
      looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and made an ineffectual
      attempt to stand up, out of respect to his benefactor, which terminated in
      his sinking back into the chair again; and the fact is, if the truth must
      be told, that Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s heart, being large enough for any six
      ordinary old gentlemen of humane disposition, forced a supply of tears
      into his eyes, by some hydraulic process which we are not sufficiently
      philosophical to be in a condition to explain.

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor boy, poor boy!&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m rather
      hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin. I&rsquo;m afraid I have caught cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bedwin. &lsquo;Everything you have had, has been
      well aired, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know, Bedwin. I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;I rather think I
      had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind that. How do
      you feel, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very happy, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver. &lsquo;And very grateful indeed, sir, for
      your goodness to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good by,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly. &lsquo;Have you given him any
      nourishment, Bedwin? Any slops, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs.
      Bedwin: drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the
      last word: to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded,
      there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; &lsquo;a couple of glasses of
      port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn&rsquo;t they, Tom
      White, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My name is Oliver, sir,&rsquo; replied the little invalid: with a look of great
      astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oliver,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;Oliver what? Oliver White, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Queer name!&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;What made you tell the magistrate
      your name was White?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never told him so, sir,&rsquo; returned Oliver in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked somewhat
      sternly in Oliver&rsquo;s face. It was impossible to doubt him; there was truth
      in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some mistake,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow. But, although his motive for looking
      steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the resemblance
      between his features and some familiar face came upon him so strongly,
      that he could not withdraw his gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you are not angry with me, sir?&rsquo; said Oliver, raising his eyes
      beseechingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied the old gentleman. &lsquo;Why! what&rsquo;s this? Bedwin, look
      there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver&rsquo;s head, and
      then to the boy&rsquo;s face. There was its living copy. The eyes, the head, the
      mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the instant, so
      precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with startling
      accuracy!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being
      strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away. A weakness
      on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of relieving the
      reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils of the Merry Old
      Gentleman; and of recording&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined in
      the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver&rsquo;s heels, in consequence of
      their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s personal property,
      as has been already described, they were actuated by a very laudable and
      becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the freedom of the
      subject and the liberty of the individual are among the first and proudest
      boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need hardly beg the reader to
      observe, that this action should tend to exalt them in the opinion of all
      public and patriotic men, in almost as great a degree as this strong proof
      of their anxiety for their own preservation and safety goes to corroborate
      and confirm the little code of laws which certain profound and
      sound-judging philosophers have laid down as the main-springs of all
      Nature&rsquo;s deeds and actions: the said philosophers very wisely reducing the
      good lady&rsquo;s proceedings to matters of maxim and theory: and, by a very
      neat and pretty compliment to her exalted wisdom and understanding,
      putting entirely out of sight any considerations of heart, or generous
      impulse and feeling. For, these are matters totally beneath a female who
      is acknowledged by universal admission to be far above the numerous little
      foibles and weaknesses of her sex.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of the
      conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate predicament, I
      should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a foregoing part of
      this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when the general attention
      was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for their home by the
      shortest possible cut. Although I do not mean to assert that it is usually
      the practice of renowned and learned sages, to shorten the road to any
      great conclusion (their course indeed being rather to lengthen the
      distance, by various circumlocutions and discursive staggerings, like unto
      those in which drunken men under the pressure of a too mighty flow of
      ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I do mean to say, and do say
      distinctly, that it is the invariable practice of many mighty
      philosophers, in carrying out their theories, to evince great wisdom and
      foresight in providing against every possible contingency which can be
      supposed at all likely to affect themselves. Thus, to do a great right,
      you may do a little wrong; and you may take any means which the end to be
      attained, will justify; the amount of the right, or the amount of the
      wrong, or indeed the distinction between the two, being left entirely to
      the philosopher concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear,
      comprehensive, and impartial view of his own particular case.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through a
      most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured to
      halt beneath a low and dark archway. Having remained silent here, just
      long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an
      exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an uncontrollable
      fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and rolled thereon in a
      transport of mirth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; inquired the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; roared Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your noise,&rsquo; remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round. &lsquo;Do
      you want to be grabbed, stupid?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; said Charley, &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it! To see him splitting
      away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and knocking up again&rsquo; 
      the posts, and starting on again as if he was made of iron as well as
      them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out arter him&mdash;oh,
      my eye!&rsquo; The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented the scene before
      him in too strong colours. As he arrived at this apostrophe, he again
      rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;ll Fagin say?&rsquo; inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next
      interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; repeated Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, what?&rsquo; said the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what should he say?&rsquo; inquired Charley: stopping rather suddenly in
      his merriment; for the Dodger&rsquo;s manner was impressive. &lsquo;What should he
      say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat,
      scratched his head, and nodded thrice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; said Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn&rsquo;t, and high
      cockolorum,&rsquo; said the Dodger: with a slight sneer on his intellectual
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was explanatory, but not satisfactory. Master Bates felt it so; and
      again said, &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering the
      skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue into his
      cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in a familiar
      but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down the court.
      Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the
      occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he sat
      over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a pocket-knife
      in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet. There was a rascally smile
      on his white face as he turned round, and looking sharply out from under
      his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the door, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, how&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; muttered the Jew: changing countenance; &lsquo;only two of
      &lsquo;em? Where&rsquo;s the third? They can&rsquo;t have got into trouble. Hark!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was
      slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it behind
      them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII &mdash; SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE
      INTELLIGENT READER, CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE
      RELATED, APPERTAINING TO THIS HISTORY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Oliver?&rsquo; said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the
      boy?&rsquo; 
    </h3>
    <p>
      The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his
      violence; and looked uneasily at each other. But they made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s become of the boy?&rsquo; said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by
      the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations. &lsquo;Speak out, or
      I&rsquo;ll throttle you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who deemed
      it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who conceived it by no
      means improbable that it might be his turn to be throttled second, dropped
      upon his knees, and raised a loud, well-sustained, and continuous roar&mdash;something
      between a mad bull and a speaking trumpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you speak?&rsquo; thundered the Jew: shaking the Dodger so much that his
      keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the traps have got him, and that&rsquo;s all about it,&rsquo; said the Dodger,
      sullenly. &lsquo;Come, let go o&rsquo; me, will you!&rsquo; And, swinging himself, at one
      jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the Jew&rsquo;s hands, the
      Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass at the merry old
      gentleman&rsquo;s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect, would have let a
      little more merriment out than could have been easily replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could have
      been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and, seizing up the
      pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant&rsquo;s head. But Charley Bates, at
      this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly terrific howl, he
      suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full at that young
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!&rsquo; growled a deep voice. &lsquo;Who
      pitched that &lsquo;ere at me? It&rsquo;s well it&rsquo;s the beer, and not the pot, as hit
      me, or I&rsquo;d have settled somebody. I might have know&rsquo;d, as nobody but an
      infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to throw away
      any drink but water&mdash;and not that, unless he done the River Company
      every quarter. Wot&rsquo;s it all about, Fagin? D&mdash;me, if my
      neck-handkercher an&rsquo;t lined with beer! Come in, you sneaking warmint; wot
      are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master! Come
      in!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of about
      five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab breeches,
      lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed a bulky pair
      of legs, with large swelling calves;&mdash;the kind of legs, which in such
      costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete state without a set
      of fetters to garnish them. He had a brown hat on his head, and a dirty
      belcher handkerchief round his neck: with the long frayed ends of which he
      smeared the beer from his face as he spoke. He disclosed, when he had done
      so, a broad heavy countenance with a beard of three days&rsquo; growth, and two
      scowling eyes; one of which displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of
      having been recently damaged by a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in, d&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; growled this engaging ruffian.
    </p>
    <p>
      A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty different
      places, skulked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you come in afore?&rsquo; said the man. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re getting too proud to
      own me afore company, are you? Lie down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the
      other end of the room. He appeared well used to it, however; for he coiled
      himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound, and winking
      his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute, appeared to occupy
      himself in taking a survey of the apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you up to? Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious,
      in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?&rsquo; said the man, seating himself deliberately. &lsquo;I
      wonder they don&rsquo;t murder you! I would if I was them. If I&rsquo;d been your
      &lsquo;prentice, I&rsquo;d have done it long ago, and&mdash;no, I couldn&rsquo;t have sold
      you afterwards, for you&rsquo;re fit for nothing but keeping as a curiousity of
      ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don&rsquo;t blow glass bottles
      large enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes,&rsquo; said the Jew, trembling; &lsquo;don&rsquo;t speak so loud!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None of your mistering,&rsquo; replied the ruffian; &lsquo;you always mean mischief
      when you come that. You know my name: out with it! I shan&rsquo;t disgrace it
      when the time comes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, then&mdash;Bill Sikes,&rsquo; said the Jew, with abject humility.
      &lsquo;You seem out of humour, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I am,&rsquo; replied Sikes; &lsquo;I should think you was rather out of sorts
      too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots about, as
      you do when you blab and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you mad?&rsquo; said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and pointing
      towards the boys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left
      ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb show
      which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly. He then, in cant terms,
      with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled, but which
      would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here, demanded a glass
      of liquor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And mind you don&rsquo;t poison it,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer
      with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard, he
      might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish (at all
      events) to improve upon the distiller&rsquo;s ingenuity not very far from the
      old gentleman&rsquo;s merry heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes condescended
      to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious act led to a
      conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver&rsquo;s capture were
      circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and improvements on the
      truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable under the circumstances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m afraid,&rsquo; said the Jew, &lsquo;that he may say something which will get us
      into trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s very likely,&rsquo; returned Sikes with a malicious grin. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re blowed
      upon, Fagin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&rsquo;m afraid, you see,&rsquo; added the Jew, speaking as if he had not
      noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did so,&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with a good many
      more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than it would for
      me, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man started, and turned round upon the Jew. But the old gentleman&rsquo;s
      shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were vacantly staring
      on the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie appeared
      plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by a certain
      malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an attack upon the
      legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter in the streets when
      he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Somebody must find out wot&rsquo;s been done at the office,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes in
      a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew nodded assent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he hasn&rsquo;t peached, and is committed, there&rsquo;s no fear till he comes out
      again,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, &lsquo;and then he must be taken care on. You must get
      hold of him somehow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again the Jew nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but,
      unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being adopted.
      This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and Mr. William
      Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and deeply-rooted
      antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or pretext whatever.
    </p>
    <p>
      How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of
      uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to guess.
      It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject, however; for the
      sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver had seen on a former
      occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very thing!&rsquo; said the Jew. &lsquo;Bet will go; won&rsquo;t you, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wheres?&rsquo; inquired the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only just up to the office, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm that
      she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and earnest
      desire to be &lsquo;blessed&rsquo; if she would; a polite and delicate evasion of the
      request, which shows the young lady to have been possessed of that natural
      good breeding which cannot bear to inflict upon a fellow-creature, the
      pain of a direct and pointed refusal.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew&rsquo;s countenance fell. He turned from this young lady, who was gaily,
      not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and yellow
      curl-papers, to the other female.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nancy, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew in a soothing manner, &lsquo;what do <i>you</i>
      say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That it won&rsquo;t do; so it&rsquo;s no use a-trying it on, Fagin,&rsquo; replied Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by that?&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I say, Bill,&rsquo; replied the lady collectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you&rsquo;re just the very person for it,&rsquo; reasoned Mr. Sikes: &lsquo;nobody
      about here knows anything of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And as I don&rsquo;t want &lsquo;em to, neither,&rsquo; replied Nancy in the same composed
      manner, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll go, Fagin,&rsquo; said Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she won&rsquo;t, Fagin,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, she will, Fagin,&rsquo; said Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Mr. Sikes was right. By dint of alternate threats, promises, and
      bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake
      the commission. She was not, indeed, withheld by the same considerations
      as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed into the
      neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb of
      Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being recognised by
      any of her numerous acquaintances.
    </p>
    <p>
      Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her
      curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,&mdash;both articles of dress
      being provided from the Jew&rsquo;s inexhaustible stock,&mdash;Miss Nancy
      prepared to issue forth on her errand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop a minute, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew, producing, a little covered
      basket. &lsquo;Carry that in one hand. It looks more respectable, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give her a door-key to carry in her t&rsquo;other one, Fagin,&rsquo; said Sikes; &lsquo;it
      looks real and genivine like.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,&rsquo; said the Jew, hanging a large street-door
      key on the forefinger of the young lady&rsquo;s right hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There; very good! Very good indeed, my dear!&rsquo; said the Jew, rubbing his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my brother! My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!&rsquo; exclaimed
      Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket and the
      street-door key in an agony of distress. &lsquo;What has become of him! Where
      have they taken him to! Oh, do have pity, and tell me what&rsquo;s been done
      with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you please, gentlemen!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone: to
      the immeasurable delight of her hearers: Miss Nancy paused, winked to the
      company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, she&rsquo;s a clever girl, my dears,&rsquo; said the Jew, turning round to his
      young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition to
      them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s a honour to her sex,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and
      smiting the table with his enormous fist. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s her health, and wishing
      they was all like her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the
      accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the
      police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity
      consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she
      arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the
      cell-doors, and listened. There was no sound within: so she coughed and
      listened again. Still there was no reply: so she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nolly, dear?&rsquo; murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; &lsquo;Nolly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been
      taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society
      having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr. Fang
      to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and amusing
      remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be more
      wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical instrument. He
      made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the loss of the flute,
      which had been confiscated for the use of the county: so Nancy passed on
      to the next cell, and knocked there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; cried a faint and feeble voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there a little boy here?&rsquo; inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the voice; &lsquo;God forbid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for <i>not</i>
      playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and
      doing nothing for his livelihood. In the next cell was another man, who
      was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without license;
      thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the Stamp-office.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or knew
      anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in the
      striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and lamentations,
      rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of the street-door key
      and the little basket, demanded her own dear brother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t got him, my dear,&rsquo; said the old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the gentleman&rsquo;s got him,&rsquo; replied the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What gentleman! Oh, gracious heavens! What gentleman?&rsquo; exclaimed Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the deeply
      affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office, and
      discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to have
      been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the prosecutor had
      carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own residence: of and
      concerning which, all the informant knew was, that it was somewhere in
      Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in the directions to the
      coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman
      staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a swift
      run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could think
      of, to the domicile of the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered,
      than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat,
      expeditiously departed: without devoting any time to the formality of
      wishing the company good-morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,&rsquo; said the Jew
      greatly excited. &lsquo;Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring home
      some news of him! Nancy, my dear, I must have him found. I trust to you,
      my dear,&mdash;to you and the Artful for everything! Stay, stay,&rsquo; added
      the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s money, my dears.
      I shall shut up this shop to-night. You&rsquo;ll know where to find me! Don&rsquo;t
      stop here a minute. Not an instant, my dears!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, he pushed them from the room: and carefully
      double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of
      concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.
      Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath
      his clothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rap at the door startled him in this occupation. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; he cried
      in a shrill tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me!&rsquo; replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What now?&rsquo; cried the Jew impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?&rsquo; inquired the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the Jew, &lsquo;wherever she lays hands on him. Find him, find
      him out, that&rsquo;s all. I shall know what to do next; never fear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy murmured a reply of intelligence: and hurried downstairs after his
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has not peached so far,&rsquo; said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.
      &lsquo;If he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth yet.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV &mdash; COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER&rsquo;S STAY AT MR.
      BROWNLOW&rsquo;S, WITH THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED
      CONCERNING HIM, WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s
      abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was
      carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the
      conversation that ensued: which indeed bore no reference to Oliver&rsquo;s
      history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse
      without exciting him. He was still too weak to get up to breakfast; but,
      when he came down into the housekeeper&rsquo;s room next day, his first act was
      to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again looking on the
      face of the beautiful lady. His expectations were disappointed, however,
      for the picture had been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver&rsquo;s eyes. &lsquo;It
      is gone, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see it is ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Oliver. &lsquo;Why have they taken it away?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it
      seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you
      know,&rsquo; rejoined the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, indeed. It didn&rsquo;t worry me, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Oliver. &lsquo;I liked to see
      it. I quite loved it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said the old lady, good-humouredly; &lsquo;you get well as fast as
      ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There! I promise you
      that! Now, let us talk about something else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at that
      time. As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he
      endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened
      attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and
      handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome man,
      and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a merchant in
      the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man, and wrote such
      dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought the tears into her
      eyes to talk about them. When the old lady had expatiated, a long time, on
      the excellences of her children, and the merits of her kind good husband
      besides, who had been dead and gone, poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty
      years, it was time to have tea. After tea she began to teach Oliver
      cribbage: which he learnt as quickly as she could teach: and at which game
      they played, with great interest and gravity, until it was time for the
      invalid to have some warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and
      then to go cosily to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were happy days, those of Oliver&rsquo;s recovery. Everything was so quiet,
      and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after the noise
      and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it seemed like
      Heaven itself. He was no sooner strong enough to put his clothes on,
      properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and a new cap, and
      a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him. As Oliver was told that he
      might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave them to a servant who
      had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell them to a Jew, and keep
      the money for herself. This she very readily did; and, as Oliver looked
      out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew roll them up in his bag and
      walk away, he felt quite delighted to think that they were safely gone,
      and that there was now no possible danger of his ever being able to wear
      them again. They were sad rags, to tell the truth; and Oliver had never
      had a new suit before.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was
      sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.
      Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see him
      in his study, and talk to him a little while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless us, and save us! Wash your hands, and let me part your hair nicely
      for you, child,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bedwin. &lsquo;Dear heart alive! If we had known he
      would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean collar on, and
      made you as smart as sixpence!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented
      grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little
      frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and handsome,
      despite that important personal advantage, that she went so far as to say:
      looking at him with great complacency from head to foot, that she really
      didn&rsquo;t think it would have been possible, on the longest notice, to have
      made much difference in him for the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door. On Mr. Brownlow calling
      to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room, quite full of
      books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little gardens. There was
      a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr. Brownlow was seated
      reading. When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book away from him, and told
      him to come near the table, and sit down. Oliver complied; marvelling
      where the people could be found to read such a great number of books as
      seemed to be written to make the world wiser. Which is still a marvel to
      more experienced people than Oliver Twist, every day of their lives.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow,
      observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the shelves that
      reached from the floor to the ceiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great number, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver. &lsquo;I never saw so many.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall read them, if you behave well,&rsquo; said the old gentleman kindly;
      &lsquo;and you will like that, better than looking at the outsides,&mdash;that
      is, some cases; because there are books of which the backs and covers are
      by far the best parts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver, pointing to some
      large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not always those,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head,
      and smiling as he did so; &lsquo;there are other equally heavy ones, though of a
      much smaller size. How should you like to grow up a clever man, and write
      books, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I would rather read them, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! wouldn&rsquo;t you like to be a book-writer?&rsquo; said the old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it
      would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old
      gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.
      Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it
      was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, composing his features. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be
      afraid! We won&rsquo;t make an author of you, while there&rsquo;s an honest trade to
      be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver. At the earnest manner of his reply, the old
      gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious instinct,
      which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the
      same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him
      assume yet, &lsquo;I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am going
      to say. I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am sure you are
      well able to understand me, as many older persons would be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!&rsquo; exclaimed
      Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman&rsquo;s commencement!
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets again. Let me stay
      here, and be a servant. Don&rsquo;t send me back to the wretched place I came
      from. Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear child,&rsquo; said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of Oliver&rsquo;s
      sudden appeal; &lsquo;you need not be afraid of my deserting you, unless you
      give me cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never, never will, sir,&rsquo; interposed Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not,&rsquo; rejoined the old gentleman. &lsquo;I do not think you ever will. I
      have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have endeavoured to
      benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you, nevertheless; and I am
      more interested in your behalf than I can well account for, even to
      myself. The persons on whom I have bestowed my dearest love, lie deep in
      their graves; but, although the happiness and delight of my life lie
      buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my heart, and sealed it up,
      forever, on my best affections. Deep affliction has but strengthened and
      refined them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the old gentleman said this in a low voice: more to himself than to his
      companion: and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards: Oliver
      sat quite still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well!&rsquo; said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful tone,
      &lsquo;I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing that I have
      suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful, perhaps, not to
      wound me again. You say you are an orphan, without a friend in the world;
      all the inquiries I have been able to make, confirm the statement. Let me
      hear your story; where you come from; who brought you up; and how you got
      into the company in which I found you. Speak the truth, and you shall not
      be friendless while I live.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver&rsquo;s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on the
      point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the farm, and
      carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly impatient little
      double-knock was heard at the street-door: and the servant, running
      upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he coming up?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied the servant. &lsquo;He asked if there were any muffins in
      the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was an
      old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in his
      manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I go downstairs, sir?&rsquo; inquired Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;I would rather you remained here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, there walked into the room: supporting himself by a thick
      stick: a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was dressed in a
      blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and gaiters, and a
      broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with green. A very
      small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat; and a very long
      steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end, dangled loosely
      below it. The ends of his white neckerchief were twisted into a ball about
      the size of an orange; the variety of shapes into which his countenance
      was twisted, defy description. He had a manner of screwing his head on one
      side when he spoke; and of looking out of the corners of his eyes at the
      same time: which irresistibly reminded the beholder of a parrot. In this
      attitude, he fixed himself, the moment he made his appearance; and,
      holding out a small piece of orange-peel at arm&rsquo;s length, exclaimed, in a
      growling, discontented voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here! do you see this! Isn&rsquo;t it a most wonderful and extraordinary
      thing that I can&rsquo;t call at a man&rsquo;s house but I find a piece of this poor
      surgeon&rsquo;s friend on the staircase? I&rsquo;ve been lamed with orange-peel once,
      and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I&rsquo;ll be content to eat my own
      head, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed
      nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his case,
      because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility of
      scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable a
      gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed, Mr.
      Grimwig&rsquo;s head was such a particularly large one, that the most sanguine
      man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get through it at
      a sitting&mdash;to put entirely out of the question, a very thick coating
      of powder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll eat my head, sir,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon the
      ground. &lsquo;Hallo! what&rsquo;s that!&rsquo; looking at Oliver, and retreating a pace or
      two.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver bowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that&rsquo;s the boy who had the fever, I hope?&rsquo; said Mr.
      Grimwig, recoiling a little more. &lsquo;Wait a minute! Don&rsquo;t speak! Stop&mdash;&rsquo; 
      continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever in his
      triumph at the discovery; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the boy who had the orange! If that&rsquo;s
      not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of peel upon the
      staircase, I&rsquo;ll eat my head, and his too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, he has not had one,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. &lsquo;Come! Put down
      your hat; and speak to my young friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feel strongly on this subject, sir,&rsquo; said the irritable old gentleman,
      drawing off his gloves. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s always more or less orange-peel on the
      pavement in our street; and I <i>know</i> it&rsquo;s put there by the surgeon&rsquo;s
      boy at the corner. A young woman stumbled over a bit last night, and fell
      against my garden-railings; directly she got up I saw her look towards his
      infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go to him,&rdquo; I called
      out of the window, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s an assassin! A man-trap!&rdquo; So he is. If he is not&mdash;&rsquo; 
      Here the irascible old gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his
      stick; which was always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary
      offer, whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his
      stick in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he
      wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver: who, seeing
      that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the boy, is it?&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig, at length.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the boy,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you, boy?&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A great deal better, thank you, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about to
      say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell Mrs.
      Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the
      visitor&rsquo;s manner, he was very happy to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. I don&rsquo;t know. I never see any difference in boys. I only knew two
      sort of boys. Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And which is Oliver?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mealy. I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they call
      him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid boy;
      with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams of his
      blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a wolf. I
      know him! The wretch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;these are not the characteristics of young
      Oliver Twist; so he needn&rsquo;t excite your wrath.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Grimwig. &lsquo;He may have worse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.
      Grimwig the most exquisite delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He may have worse, I say,&rsquo; repeated Mr. Grimwig. &lsquo;Where does he come
      from! Who is he? What is he? He has had a fever. What of that? Fevers are
      not peculiar to good people; are they? Bad people have fevers sometimes;
      haven&rsquo;t they, eh? I knew a man who was hung in Jamaica for murdering his
      master. He had had a fever six times; he wasn&rsquo;t recommended to mercy on
      that account. Pooh! nonsense!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.
      Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver&rsquo;s appearance and manner
      were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for
      contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the
      orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to him
      whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the first, to
      oppose his friend. When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one point of
      inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he had
      postponed any investigation into Oliver&rsquo;s previous history until he
      thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled
      maliciously. And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper was in
      the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn&rsquo;t find a
      table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would be content
      to&mdash;and so forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous
      gentleman: knowing his friend&rsquo;s peculiarities, bore with great good
      humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his
      entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and Oliver,
      who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than he had yet
      done in the fierce old gentleman&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of
      the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?&rsquo; asked Grimwig of Mr. Brownlow,
      at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as he resumed
      his subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow morning,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;I would rather he was alone
      with me at the time. Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten o&rsquo;clock, my
      dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver. He answered with some hesitation, because he
      was confused by Mr. Grimwig&rsquo;s looking so hard at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what,&rsquo; whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;he won&rsquo;t
      come up to you to-morrow morning. I saw him hesitate. He is deceiving you,
      my good friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll swear he is not,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he is not,&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo; and down went the stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll answer for that boy&rsquo;s truth with my life!&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow,
      knocking the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I for his falsehood with my head!&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking the
      table also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall see,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We will,&rsquo; replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile; &lsquo;we will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment, a
      small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased of
      the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this history;
      having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;there is something to go
      back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has gone, sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bedwin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Call after him,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s particular. He is a poor man,
      and they are not paid for. There are some books to be taken back, too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The street-door was opened. Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran another;
      and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy; but there was
      no boy in sight. Oliver and the girl returned, in a breathless state, to
      report that there were no tidings of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me, I am very sorry for that,&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;I
      particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send Oliver with them,&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; &lsquo;he
      will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll run all
      the way, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out on
      any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined him
      that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the commission, he
      should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions: on this head at
      least: at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>shall</i> go, my dear,&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;The books are on
      a chair by my table. Fetch them down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in a
      great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to
      take.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are to say,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; &lsquo;you
      are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have come
      to pay the four pound ten I owe him. This is a five-pound note, so you
      will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t be ten minutes, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver, eagerly. Having buttoned up
      the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully under
      his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room. Mrs. Bedwin followed
      him to the street-door, giving him many directions about the nearest way,
      and the name of the bookseller, and the name of the street: all of which
      Oliver said he clearly understood. Having superadded many injunctions to
      be sure and not take cold, the old lady at length permitted him to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless his sweet face!&rsquo; said the old lady, looking after him. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t
      bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned the
      corner. The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and, closing the
      door, went back to her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see; he&rsquo;ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table. &lsquo;It will be
      dark by that time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Grimwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig&rsquo;s breast, at the
      moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend&rsquo;s confident smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; he said, smiting the table with his fist, &lsquo;I do not. The boy has a
      new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his arm,
      and a five-pound note in his pocket. He&rsquo;ll join his old friends the
      thieves, and laugh at you. If ever that boy returns to this house, sir,
      I&rsquo;ll eat my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the two
      friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our
      own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and
      hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a
      bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see
      his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly and
      strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.
    </p>
    <p>
      It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely
      discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in silence,
      with the watch between them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV &mdash; SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD
      JEW AND MISS NANCY WERE
    </h2>
    <p>
      In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of
      Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light
      burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in
      the summer: there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a small
      glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a velveteen
      coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by that dim light
      no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated to recognise as
      Mr. William Sikes. At his feet, sat a white-coated, red-eyed dog; who
      occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his master with both eyes at
      the same time; and in licking a large, fresh cut on one side of his mouth,
      which appeared to be the result of some recent conflict.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep quiet, you warmint! Keep quiet!&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, suddenly breaking
      silence. Whether his meditations were so intense as to be disturbed by the
      dog&rsquo;s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought upon by his
      reflections that they required all the relief derivable from kicking an
      unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for argument and
      consideration. Whatever was the cause, the effect was a kick and a curse,
      bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by
      their masters; but Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s dog, having faults of temper in common with
      his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a powerful sense
      of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth in one of the
      half-boots. Having given in a hearty shake, he retired, growling, under a
      form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr. Sikes levelled at his
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would, would you?&rsquo; said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and
      deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew
      from his pocket. &lsquo;Come here, you born devil! Come here! D&rsquo;ye hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest key
      of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some unaccountable
      objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he was, and growled
      more fiercely than before: at the same time grasping the end of the poker
      between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on his
      knees, began to assail the animal most furiously. The dog jumped from
      right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and barking;
      the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the struggle was
      reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the door suddenly
      opening, the dog darted out: leaving Bill Sikes with the poker and the
      clasp-knife in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage. Mr.
      Sikes, being disappointed of the dog&rsquo;s participation, at once transferred
      his share in the quarrel to the new comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?&rsquo; said Sikes,
      with a fierce gesture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know, my dear, I didn&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Fagin, humbly; for the
      Jew was the new comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t know, you white-livered thief!&rsquo; growled Sikes. &lsquo;Couldn&rsquo;t you hear
      the noise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a sound of it, as I&rsquo;m a living man, Bill,&rsquo; replied the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no! You hear nothing, you don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; retorted Sikes with a fierce sneer.
      &lsquo;Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go! I wish you
      had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; inquired the Jew with a forced smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as
      haven&rsquo;t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,&rsquo; 
      replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      why.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to
      laugh at the pleasantry of his friend. He was obviously very ill at ease,
      however.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grin away,&rsquo; said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with
      savage contempt; &lsquo;grin away. You&rsquo;ll never have the laugh at me, though,
      unless it&rsquo;s behind a nightcap. I&rsquo;ve got the upper hand over you, Fagin;
      and, d&mdash;me, I&rsquo;ll keep it. There! If I go, you go; so take care of
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew, &lsquo;I know all that; we&mdash;we&mdash;have
      a mutual interest, Bill,&mdash;a mutual interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph,&rsquo; said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on the
      Jew&rsquo;s side than on his. &lsquo;Well, what have you got to say to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all passed safe through the melting-pot,&rsquo; replied Fagin, &lsquo;and this
      is your share. It&rsquo;s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but as I
      know you&rsquo;ll do me a good turn another time, and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stow that gammon,&rsquo; interposed the robber, impatiently. &lsquo;Where is it? Hand
      over!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,&rsquo; replied the Jew, soothingly.
      &lsquo;Here it is! All safe!&rsquo; As he spoke, he drew forth an old cotton
      handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in one corner,
      produced a small brown-paper packet. Sikes, snatching it from him, hastily
      opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it contained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is all, is it?&rsquo; inquired Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All,&rsquo; replied the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You haven&rsquo;t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come along,
      have you?&rsquo; inquired Sikes, suspiciously. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t put on an injured look at
      the question; you&rsquo;ve done it many a time. Jerk the tinkler.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell. It
      was answered by another Jew: younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile and
      repulsive in appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure. The Jew, perfectly
      understanding the hint, retired to fill it: previously exchanging a
      remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if in
      expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the
      action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third person.
      It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie the
      boot-lace which the dog had torn. Possibly, if he had observed the brief
      interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no good to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is anybody here, Barney?&rsquo; inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that Sikes
      was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dot a shoul,&rsquo; replied Barney; whose words: whether they came from the
      heart or not: made their way through the nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody?&rsquo; inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise: which perhaps might mean
      that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dobody but Biss Dadsy,&rsquo; replied Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nancy!&rsquo; exclaimed Sikes. &lsquo;Where? Strike me blind, if I don&rsquo;t honour that
      &lsquo;ere girl, for her native talents.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,&rsquo; replied Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Send her here,&rsquo; said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. &lsquo;Send her
      here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining
      silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and
      presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the bonnet,
      apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?&rsquo; inquired Sikes, proffering the
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am, Bill,&rsquo; replied the young lady, disposing of its contents; &lsquo;and
      tired enough of it I am, too. The young brat&rsquo;s been ill and confined to
      the crib; and&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, Nancy, dear!&rsquo; said Fagin, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew&rsquo;s red eye-brows, and a half
      closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was disposed to
      be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance. The fact is all
      we need care for here; and the fact is, that she suddenly checked herself,
      and with several gracious smiles upon Mr. Sikes, turned the conversation
      to other matters. In about ten minutes&rsquo; time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a
      fit of coughing; upon which Nancy pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and
      declared it was time to go. Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short
      part of her way himself, expressed his intention of accompanying her; they
      went away together, followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk
      out of a back-yard as soon as his master was out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;
      looked after him as we walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched
      fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated
      himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the interesting
      pages of the Hue-and-Cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very short
      a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the book-stall.
      When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a by-street which
      was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his mistake until he had
      got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in the right direction, he
      did not think it worth while to turn back; and so marched on, as quickly
      as he could, with the books under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to feel;
      and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick, who,
      starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment; when he
      was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud. &lsquo;Oh, my dear
      brother!&rsquo; And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter was, when he
      was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried Oliver, struggling. &lsquo;Let go of me. Who is it? What are you
      stopping me for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from the
      young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a
      street-door key in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh my gracious!&rsquo; said the young woman, &lsquo;I have found him! Oh! Oliver!
      Oliver! Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your
      account! Come home, dear, come. Oh, I&rsquo;ve found him. Thank gracious
      goodness heavins, I&rsquo;ve found him!&rsquo; With these incoherent exclamations, the
      young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully
      hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a
      butcher&rsquo;s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was also
      looking on, whether he didn&rsquo;t think he had better run for the doctor. To
      which, the butcher&rsquo;s boy: who appeared of a lounging, not to say indolent
      disposition: replied, that he thought not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no, no, never mind,&rsquo; said the young woman, grasping Oliver&rsquo;s hand;
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m better now. Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied the young woman, &lsquo;he ran away, near a month ago, from
      his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went and
      joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his mother&rsquo;s
      heart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young wretch!&rsquo; said one woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go home, do, you little brute,&rsquo; said the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not,&rsquo; replied Oliver, greatly alarmed. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know her. I haven&rsquo;t
      any sister, or father and mother either. I&rsquo;m an orphan; I live at
      Pentonville.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only hear him, how he braves it out!&rsquo; cried the young woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it&rsquo;s Nancy!&rsquo; exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first
      time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see he knows me!&rsquo; cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t
      help himself. Make him come home, there&rsquo;s good people, or he&rsquo;ll kill his
      dear mother and father, and break my heart!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with a
      white dog at his heels; &lsquo;young Oliver! Come home to your poor mother, you
      young dog! Come home directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t belong to them. I don&rsquo;t know them. Help! help!&rsquo; cried Oliver,
      struggling in the man&rsquo;s powerful grasp.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0099.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; repeated the man. &lsquo;Yes; I&rsquo;ll help you, you young rascal!
    </p>
    <p>
      What books are these? You&rsquo;ve been a stealing &lsquo;em, have you? Give &lsquo;em
      here.&rsquo; With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and
      struck him on the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right!&rsquo; cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the only
      way of bringing him to his senses!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look at
      the garret-window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll do him good!&rsquo; said the two women.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he shall have it, too!&rsquo; rejoined the man, administering another blow,
      and seizing Oliver by the collar. &lsquo;Come on, you young villain! Here,
      Bull&rsquo;s-eye, mind him, boy! Mind him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of the
      attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the brutality of
      the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders that he really
      was the hardened little wretch he was described to be; what could one poor
      child do! Darkness had set in; it was a low neighborhood; no help was
      near; resistance was useless. In another moment he was dragged into a
      labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was forced along them at a pace which
      rendered the few cries he dared to give utterance to, unintelligible. It
      was of little moment, indeed, whether they were intelligible or no; for
      there was nobody to care for them, had they been ever so plain.

      The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the open
      door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if there were
      any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat, perseveringly,
      in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVI &mdash; RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN
      CLAIMED BY NANCY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open
      space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other indications
      of a cattle-market. Sikes slackened his pace when they reached this spot:
      the girl being quite unable to support any longer, the rapid rate at which
      they had hitherto walked. Turning to Oliver, he roughly commanded him to
      take hold of Nancy&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear?&rsquo; growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail. He held
      out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give me the other,&rsquo; said Sikes, seizing Oliver&rsquo;s unoccupied hand. &lsquo;Here,
      Bull&rsquo;s-Eye!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog looked up, and growled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See here, boy!&rsquo; said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver&rsquo;s throat;
      &lsquo;if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him! D&rsquo;ye mind!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were
      anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Sikes,
      regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval. &lsquo;Now, you
      know what you&rsquo;ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick as you like;
      the dog will soon stop that game. Get on, young&rsquo;un!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bull&rsquo;s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually endearing
      form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl for the
      benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been
      Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night was
      dark and foggy. The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle through
      the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the streets and
      houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger in Oliver&rsquo;s
      eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and depressing.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the hour.
      With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned their heads
      in the direction whence the sound proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Eight o&rsquo; clock, Bill,&rsquo; said Nancy, when the bell ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can&rsquo;t I!&rsquo; replied
      Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wonder whether <i>they</i> can hear it,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course they can,&rsquo; replied Sikes. &lsquo;It was Bartlemy time when I was
      shopped; and there warn&rsquo;t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn&rsquo;t hear
      the squeaking on. Arter I was locked up for the night, the row and din
      outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could almost have
      beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the
      quarter in which the bell had sounded. &lsquo;Oh, Bill, such fine young chaps as
      them!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; that&rsquo;s all you women think of,&rsquo; answered Sikes. &lsquo;Fine young chaps!
      Well, they&rsquo;re as good as dead, so it don&rsquo;t much matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency to
      jealousy, and, clasping Oliver&rsquo;s wrist more firmly, told him to step out
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wait a minute!&rsquo; said the girl: &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t hurry by, if it was you that
      was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o&rsquo;clock struck, Bill. I&rsquo;d
      walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow was on the
      ground, and I hadn&rsquo;t a shawl to cover me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what good would that do?&rsquo; inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes.
      &lsquo;Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout rope,
      you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at all, for
      all the good it would do me. Come on, and don&rsquo;t stand preaching there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and
      they walked away. But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in her
      face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly white.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full half-hour:
      meeting very few people, and those appearing from their looks to hold much
      the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself. At length they turned
      into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of old-clothes shops; the
      dog running forward, as if conscious that there was no further occasion
      for his keeping on guard, stopped before the door of a shop that was
      closed and apparently untenanted; the house was in a ruinous condition,
      and on the door was nailed a board, intimating that it was to let: which
      looked as if it had hung there for many years.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.
      They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few
      moments under a lamp. A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised, was
      heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened. Mr. Sikes then seized
      the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and all three
      were quickly inside the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passage was perfectly dark. They waited, while the person who had let
      them in, chained and barred the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anybody here?&rsquo; inquired Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the old &lsquo;un here?&rsquo; asked the robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied the voice, &lsquo;and precious down in the mouth he has been.
      Won&rsquo;t he be glad to see you? Oh, no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it, seemed
      familiar to Oliver&rsquo;s ears: but it was impossible to distinguish even the
      form of the speaker in the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let&rsquo;s have a glim,&rsquo; said Sikes, &lsquo;or we shall go breaking our necks, or
      treading on the dog. Look after your legs if you do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand still a moment, and I&rsquo;ll get you one,&rsquo; replied the voice. The
      receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute, the
      form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared. He bore
      in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft stick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of recognition
      upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away, beckoned the
      visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They crossed an empty
      kitchen; and, opening the door of a low earthy-smelling room, which seemed
      to have been built in a small back-yard, were received with a shout of
      laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, my wig, my wig!&rsquo; cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the
      laughter had proceeded: &lsquo;here he is! oh, cry, here he is! Oh, Fagin, look
      at him! Fagin, do look at him! I can&rsquo;t bear it; it is such a jolly game, I
      cant&rsquo; bear it. Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself
      flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an ectasy
      of facetious joy. Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the cleft stick
      from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round and round;
      while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number of low bows to
      the bewildered boy. The Artful, meantime, who was of a rather saturnine
      disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it interfered with
      business, rifled Oliver&rsquo;s pockets with steady assiduity.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0105.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look at his togs, Fagin!&rsquo; said Charley, putting the light so close to his
      new jacket as nearly to set him on fire. &lsquo;Look at his togs! Superfine
      cloth, and the heavy swell cut! Oh, my eye, what a game! And his books,
      too! Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew, bowing with
      mock humility. &lsquo;The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear, for fear
      you should spoil that Sunday one. Why didn&rsquo;t you write, my dear, and say
      you were coming? We&rsquo;d have got something warm for supper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,
      and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound
      note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery
      awakened his merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo, what&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew seized
      the note. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s mine, Fagin.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew. &lsquo;Mine, Bill, mine. You shall have the
      books.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that ain&rsquo;t mine!&rsquo; said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a
      determined air; &lsquo;mine and Nancy&rsquo;s that is; I&rsquo;ll take the boy back again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew started. Oliver started too, though from a very different cause;
      for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being taken back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come! Hand over, will you?&rsquo; said Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?&rsquo; inquired the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fair, or not fair,&rsquo; retorted Sikes, &lsquo;hand over, I tell you! Do you think
      Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time but to
      spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as gets
      grabbed through you? Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton, give it
      here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between the
      Jew&rsquo;s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face, folded
      it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for our share of the trouble,&rsquo; said Sikes; &lsquo;and not half enough,
      neither. You may keep the books, if you&rsquo;re fond of reading. If you ain&rsquo;t,
      sell &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re very pretty,&rsquo; said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces, had
      been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; &lsquo;beautiful writing,
      isn&rsquo;t is, Oliver?&rsquo; At sight of the dismayed look with which Oliver
      regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a lively sense
      of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more boisterous than the
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They belong to the old gentleman,&rsquo; said Oliver, wringing his hands; &lsquo;to
      the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had me
      nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back; send
      him back the books and money. Keep me here all my life long; but pray,
      pray send them back. He&rsquo;ll think I stole them; the old lady: all of them
      who were so kind to me: will think I stole them. Oh, do have mercy upon
      me, and send them back!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate
      grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew&rsquo;s feet; and beat his hands
      together, in perfect desperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting
      his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right, Oliver, you&rsquo;re right;
      they <i>will</i> think you have stolen &lsquo;em. Ha! ha!&rsquo; chuckled the Jew,
      rubbing his hands, &lsquo;it couldn&rsquo;t have happened better, if we had chosen our
      time!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it couldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Sikes; &lsquo;I know&rsquo;d that, directly I see him
      coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm. It&rsquo;s all right
      enough. They&rsquo;re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn&rsquo;t have taken
      him in at all; and they&rsquo;ll ask no questions after him, fear they should be
      obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged. He&rsquo;s safe enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being
      spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what
      passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet, and
      tore wildly from the room: uttering shrieks for help, which made the bare
      old house echo to the roof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep back the dog, Bill!&rsquo; cried Nancy, springing before the door, and
      closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit. &lsquo;Keep
      back the dog; he&rsquo;ll tear the boy to pieces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Serve him right!&rsquo; cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from the
      girl&rsquo;s grasp. &lsquo;Stand off from me, or I&rsquo;ll split your head against the
      wall.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for that, Bill, I don&rsquo;t care for that,&rsquo; screamed the girl,
      struggling violently with the man, &lsquo;the child shan&rsquo;t be torn down by the
      dog, unless you kill me first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shan&rsquo;t he!&rsquo; said Sikes, setting his teeth. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll soon do that, if you
      don&rsquo;t keep off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the room,
      just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here!&rsquo; said Fagin, looking round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The girl&rsquo;s gone mad, I think,&rsquo; replied Sikes, savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, she hasn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle; &lsquo;no,
      she hasn&rsquo;t, Fagin; don&rsquo;t think it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then keep quiet, will you?&rsquo; said the Jew, with a threatening look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I won&rsquo;t do that, neither,&rsquo; replied Nancy, speaking very loud. &lsquo;Come!
      What do you think of that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs of
      that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel
      tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any
      conversation with her, at present. With the view of diverting the
      attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?&rsquo; said the Jew, taking up a
      jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; &lsquo;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver made no reply. But he watched the Jew&rsquo;s motions, and breathed
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?&rsquo; sneered the
      Jew, catching the boy by the arm. &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll cure you of that, my young
      master.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver&rsquo;s shoulders with the club; and
      was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it
      from his hand. She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought some
      of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t stand by and see it done, Fagin,&rsquo; cried the girl. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve got the
      boy, and what more would you have?&mdash;Let him be&mdash;let him be&mdash;or
      I shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows
      before my time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this
      threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked
      alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless
      from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Nancy!&rsquo; said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during
      which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted manner;
      &lsquo;you,&mdash;you&rsquo;re more clever than ever to-night. Ha! ha! my dear, you
      are acting beautifully.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I!&rsquo; said the girl. &lsquo;Take care I don&rsquo;t overdo it. You will be the worse
      for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep clear of
      me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all her
      other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and despair;
      which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be hopeless to
      affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss Nancy&rsquo;s rage;
      and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a glance, half
      imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that he was the
      fittest person to pursue the dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal
      pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy to
      reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and threats,
      the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the fertility of
      his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the object against
      whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more tangible
      arguments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by this?&rsquo; said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very
      common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features: which,
      if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand times that
      it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a disorder as
      measles: &lsquo;what do you mean by it? Burn my body! Do you know who you are,
      and what you are?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, I know all about it,&rsquo; replied the girl, laughing hysterically;
      and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor assumption of
      indifference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, keep quiet,&rsquo; rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was
      accustomed to use when addressing his dog, &lsquo;or I&rsquo;ll quiet you for a good
      long time to come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting a
      hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the blood
      came.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a nice one,&rsquo; added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a contemptuous
      air, &lsquo;to take up the humane and gen&mdash;teel side! A pretty subject for
      the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God Almighty help me, I am!&rsquo; cried the girl passionately; &lsquo;and I wish I
      had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them we
      passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him here.
      He&rsquo;s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that&rsquo;s bad, from this night forth.
      Isn&rsquo;t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, Sikes,&rsquo; said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory
      tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all
      that passed; &lsquo;we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Civil words!&rsquo; cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see. &lsquo;Civil
      words, you villain! Yes, you deserve &lsquo;em from me. I thieved for you when I
      was a child not half as old as this!&rsquo; pointing to Oliver. &lsquo;I have been in
      the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve years since. Don&rsquo;t you
      know it? Speak out! Don&rsquo;t you know it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; &lsquo;and, if
      you have, it&rsquo;s your living!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye, it is!&rsquo; returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the words
      in one continuous and vehement scream. &lsquo;It is my living; and the cold,
      wet, dirty streets are my home; and you&rsquo;re the wretch that drove me to
      them long ago, and that&rsquo;ll keep me there, day and night, day and night,
      till I die!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall do you a mischief!&rsquo; interposed the Jew, goaded by these
      reproaches; &lsquo;a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a transport
      of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably have left signal
      marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been seized by Sikes at
      the right moment; upon which, she made a few ineffectual struggles, and
      fainted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s all right now,&rsquo; said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s
      uncommon strong in the arms, when she&rsquo;s up in this way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have the
      disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the boys,
      seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance
      incidental to business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the worst of having to do with women,&rsquo; said the Jew, replacing his
      club; &lsquo;but they&rsquo;re clever, and we can&rsquo;t get on, in our line, without &lsquo;em.
      Charley, show Oliver to bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose he&rsquo;d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had he?&rsquo; 
      inquired Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which
      Charley put the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the
      cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were two
      or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with many
      uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old suit of
      clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon leaving off at
      Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s; and the accidental display of which, to Fagin, by the Jew
      who purchased them, had been the very first clue received, of his
      whereabout.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put off the smart ones,&rsquo; said Charley, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll give &lsquo;em to Fagin to
      take care of. What fun it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Oliver unwillingly complied. Master Bates rolling up the new clothes
      under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the dark, and
      locking the door behind him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise of Charley&rsquo;s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who
      opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other
      feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept many
      people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which Oliver was
      placed. But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound asleep.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVII &mdash; OLIVER&rsquo;S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A
      GREAT MAN TO LONDON TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION
    </h2>
    <p>
      It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to
      present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as the
      layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon. The hero sinks upon
      his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the next scene,
      his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience with a comic
      song. We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in the grasp of a
      proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike in danger, drawing
      forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of the other; and just as
      our expectations are wrought up to the highest pitch, a whistle is heard,
      and we are straightway transported to the great hall of the castle; where
      a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny chorus with a funnier body of
      vassals, who are free of all sorts of places, from church vaults to
      palaces, and roam about in company, carolling perpetually.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would
      seem at first sight. The transitions in real life from well-spread boards
      to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are not a whit
      less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of passive
      lookers-on, which makes a vast difference. The actors in the mimic life of
      the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt impulses of
      passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of mere spectators,
      are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.
    </p>
    <p>
      As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place, are
      not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many considered as
      the great art of authorship: an author&rsquo;s skill in his craft being, by such
      critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the dilemmas in which he
      leaves his characters at the end of every chapter: this brief introduction
      to the present one may perhaps be deemed unnecessary. If so, let it be
      considered a delicate intimation on the part of the historian that he is
      going back to the town in which Oliver Twist was born; the reader taking
      it for granted that there are good and substantial reasons for making the
      journey, or he would not be invited to proceed upon such an expedition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked
      with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street. He was in
      the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were
      dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous
      tenacity of health and power. Mr. Bumble always carried his head high; but
      this morning it was higher than usual. There was an abstraction in his
      eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant
      stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle&rsquo;s mind, too great for
      utterance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and others
      who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along. He merely returned
      their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in his
      dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended the
      infant paupers with parochial care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drat that beadle!&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at the
      garden-gate. &lsquo;If it isn&rsquo;t him at this time in the morning! Lauk, Mr.
      Bumble, only think of its being you! Well, dear me, it <i>is</i> a
      pleasure, this is! Come into the parlour, sir, please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of delight
      were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the garden-gate: and
      showed him, with great attention and respect, into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Mann,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself into a
      seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself gradually and
      slowly down into a chair; &lsquo;Mrs. Mann, ma&rsquo;am, good morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, and good morning to <i>you</i>, sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Mann, with many
      smiles; &lsquo;and hoping you find yourself well, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So-so, Mrs. Mann,&rsquo; replied the beadle. &lsquo;A porochial life is not a bed of
      roses, Mrs. Mann.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, that it isn&rsquo;t indeed, Mr. Bumble,&rsquo; rejoined the lady. And all the
      infant paupers might have chorused the rejoinder with great propriety, if
      they had heard it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A porochial life, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table with
      his cane, &lsquo;is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but all
      public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her hands
      with a look of sympathy, and sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!&rsquo; said the beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again: evidently to the
      satisfaction of the public character: who, repressing a complacent smile
      by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Mann, I am going to London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lauk, Mr. Bumble!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To London, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; resumed the inflexible beadle, &lsquo;by coach. I and two
      paupers, Mrs. Mann! A legal action is a coming on, about a settlement; and
      the board has appointed me&mdash;me, Mrs. Mann&mdash;to dispose to the
      matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.
    </p>
    <p>
      And I very much question,&rsquo; added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up, &lsquo;whether
      the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong box before
      they have done with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you mustn&rsquo;t be too hard upon them, sir,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied
      Mr. Bumble; &lsquo;and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they come off
      rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have only
      themselves to thank.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing
      manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.
      Mann appeared quite awed by them. At length she said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going by coach, sir? I thought it was always usual to send them
      paupers in carts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s when they&rsquo;re ill, Mrs. Mann,&rsquo; said the beadle. &lsquo;We put the sick
      paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their taking
      cold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;They are both in a very low state, and we find it would come
      two pound cheaper to move &lsquo;em than to bury &lsquo;em&mdash;that is, if we can
      throw &lsquo;em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to do, if
      they don&rsquo;t die upon the road to spite us. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered the
      cocked hat; and he became grave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are forgetting business, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the beadle; &lsquo;here is your
      porochial stipend for the month.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his
      pocket-book; and requested a receipt: which Mrs. Mann wrote.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very much blotted, sir,&rsquo; said the farmer of infants; &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s
      formal enough, I dare say. Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much
      obliged to you, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann&rsquo;s curtsey; and
      inquired how the children were.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bless their dear little hearts!&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann with emotion, &lsquo;they&rsquo;re as
      well as can be, the dears! Of course, except the two that died last week.
      And little Dick.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t that boy no better?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Mann shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Bumble angrily. &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Mann. &lsquo;Here, you
      Dick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After some calling, Dick was discovered. Having had his face put under the
      pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann&rsquo;s gown, he was led into the awful presence
      of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large
      and bright. The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung
      loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like
      those of an old man.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s glance;
      not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even to hear the
      beadle&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with you, porochial Dick?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Bumble, with
      well-timed jocularity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, sir,&rsquo; replied the child faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should think not,&rsquo; said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very much
      at Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You want for nothing, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like&mdash;&rsquo; faltered the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hey-day!&rsquo; interposed Mr. Mann, &lsquo;I suppose you&rsquo;re going to say that you <i>do</i>
      want for something, now? Why, you little wretch&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!&rsquo; said the beadle, raising his hand with a show of
      authority. &lsquo;Like what, sir, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like,&rsquo; faltered the child, &lsquo;if somebody that can write, would
      put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and seal
      it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what does the boy mean?&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the earnest
      manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression: accustomed as
      he was to such things. &lsquo;What do you mean, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like,&rsquo; said the child, &lsquo;to leave my dear love to poor Oliver
      Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to
      think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help him.
      And I should like to tell him,&rsquo; said the child pressing his small hands
      together, and speaking with great fervour, &lsquo;that I was glad to die when I
      was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man, and had grown
      old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me, or be unlike me;
      and it would be so much happier if we were both children there together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with
      indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said, &lsquo;They&rsquo;re
      all in one story, Mrs. Mann. That out-dacious Oliver had demogalized them
      all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t have believed it, sir&rsquo; said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands,
      and looking malignantly at Dick. &lsquo;I never see such a hardened little
      wretch!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take him away, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble imperiously. &lsquo;This must be stated
      to the board, Mrs. Mann.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn&rsquo;t my fault, sir?&rsquo; said
      Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They shall understand that, ma&rsquo;am; they shall be acquainted with the true
      state of the case,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;There; take him away, I can&rsquo;t bear
      the sight on him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar. Mr.
      Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      At six o&rsquo;clock next morning, Mr. Bumble: having exchanged his cocked hat
      for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a cape
      to it: took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by the
      criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course of time,
      he arrived in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated in
      the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in shivering, and
      complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble declared, caused
      his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel quite uncomfortable;
      although he had a great-coat on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble sat
      himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a temperate
      dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass of hot
      gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the fire; and,
      with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of discontent and
      complaining, composed himself to read the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s eye rested, was the
      following advertisement.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
                 &lsquo;FIVE GUINEAS REWARD

     &lsquo;Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or
     enticed, on Thursday evening last, from his home, at was
     Pentonville; and has not since been heard of. The above
     reward will be paid to any person who will give such
     information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver
     Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history,
     in which the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly
     interested.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      And then followed a full description of Oliver&rsquo;s dress, person,
      appearance, and disappearance: with the name and address of Mr. Brownlow
      at full length.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and carefully,
      three several times; and in something more than five minutes was on his
      way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left the glass of
      hot gin-and-water, untasted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Mr. Brownlow at home?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive
      reply of &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; where do you come from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver&rsquo;s name, in explanation of his errand,
      than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door, hastened
      into the passage in a breathless state.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in, come in,&rsquo; said the old lady: &lsquo;I knew we should hear of him. Poor
      dear! I knew we should! I was certain of it. Bless his heart! I said so
      all along.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour
      again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who was
      not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now returned
      with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately: which he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his
      friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them. The latter
      gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A beadle. A parish beadle, or I&rsquo;ll eat my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray don&rsquo;t interrupt just now,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;Take a seat, will
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.
      Grimwig&rsquo;s manner. Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an
      uninterrupted view of the beadle&rsquo;s countenance; and said, with a little
      impatience, &lsquo;Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the
      advertisement?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you <i>are</i> a beadle, are you not?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Grimwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, &lsquo;I knew he was. A
      beadle all over!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and
      resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know where this poor boy is now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more than nobody,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what <i>do</i> you know of him?&rsquo; inquired the old gentleman. &lsquo;Speak
      out, my friend, if you have anything to say. What <i>do</i> you know of
      him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t happen to know any good of him, do you?&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig,
      caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s features.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with
      portentous solemnity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see?&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s pursed-up countenance;
      and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding Oliver, in as few
      words as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms;
      inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments&rsquo; 
      reflection, commenced his story.
    </p>
    <p>
      It would be tedious if given in the beadle&rsquo;s words: occupying, as it did,
      some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of it was,
      that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents. That he had,
      from his birth, displayed no better qualities than treachery, ingratitude,
      and malice. That he had terminated his brief career in the place of his
      birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly attack on an unoffending lad,
      and running away in the night-time from his master&rsquo;s house. In proof of
      his really being the person he represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon
      the table the papers he had brought to town. Folding his arms again, he
      then awaited Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s observations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear it is all too true,&rsquo; said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after
      looking over the papers. &lsquo;This is not much for your intelligence; but I
      would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been favourable to
      the boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this
      information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have imparted
      a very different colouring to his little history. It was too late to do it
      now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and, pocketing the five
      guineas, withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so much
      disturbed by the beadle&rsquo;s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to vex him
      further.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Bedwin,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; &lsquo;that
      boy, Oliver, is an imposter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t be, sir. It cannot be,&rsquo; said the old lady energetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you he is,&rsquo; retorted the old gentleman. &lsquo;What do you mean by can&rsquo;t
      be? We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and he has
      been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never will believe it, sir,&rsquo; replied the old lady, firmly. &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying
      story-books,&rsquo; growled Mr. Grimwig. &lsquo;I knew it all along. Why didn&rsquo;t you
      take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn&rsquo;t had a fever, I
      suppose, eh? He was interesting, wasn&rsquo;t he? Interesting! Bah!&rsquo; And Mr.
      Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,&rsquo; retorted Mrs. Bedwin,
      indignantly. &lsquo;I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty
      years; and people who can&rsquo;t say the same, shouldn&rsquo;t say anything about
      them. That&rsquo;s my opinion!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor. As it extorted
      nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head, and
      smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was
      stopped by Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from
      feeling. &lsquo;Never let me hear the boy&rsquo;s name again. I rang to tell you that.
      Never. Never, on any pretence, mind! You may leave the room, Mrs. Bedwin.
      Remember! I am in earnest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver&rsquo;s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it
      was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it might
      have broken outright.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XVIII &mdash; HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY
      OF HIS REPUTABLE FRIENDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to
      pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of
      reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of which
      he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary extent, in
      wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious friends; and,
      still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so much trouble and
      expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin laid great stress on
      the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and cherished him, when, without
      his timely aid, he might have perished with hunger; and he related the
      dismal and affecting history of a young lad whom, in his philanthropy, he
      had succoured under parallel circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of
      his confidence and evincing a desire to communicate with the police, had
      unfortunately come to be hanged at the Old Bailey one morning. Mr. Fagin
      did not seek to conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with
      tears in his eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the
      young person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become
      the victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not
      precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr.
      Fagin) and a few select friends. Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a rather
      disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with great
      friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious hopes that he
      might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that unpleasant
      operation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Little Oliver&rsquo;s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew&rsquo;s words, and
      imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them. That it was
      possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the guilty
      when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and that
      deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or
      over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by the
      Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely, when he
      recollected the general nature of the altercations between that gentleman
      and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some foregone conspiracy
      of the kind. As he glanced timidly up, and met the Jew&rsquo;s searching look,
      he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs were neither unnoticed nor
      unrelished by that wary old gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that if
      he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they would
      be very good friends yet. Then, taking his hat, and covering himself with
      an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the room-door behind
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many
      subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and
      left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts. Which, never
      failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must long ago
      have formed of him, were sad indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked; and
      he was at liberty to wander about the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very dirty place. The rooms upstairs had great high wooden
      chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the
      ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were
      ornamented in various ways. From all of these tokens Oliver concluded that
      a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to better
      people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome: dismal and dreary as
      it looked now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings; and
      sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would scamper
      across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes. With these
      exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living thing; and
      often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from room to room,
      he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the street-door, to be as
      near living people as he could; and would remain there, listening and
      counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed: the bars which
      held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which was
      admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which made the
      rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows. There was a
      back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no shutter; and out
      of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for hours together; but
      nothing was to be descried from it but a confused and crowded mass of
      housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends. Sometimes, indeed, a
      grizzly head might be seen, peering over the parapet-wall of a distant
      house; but it was quickly withdrawn again; and as the window of Oliver&rsquo;s
      observatory was nailed down, and dimmed with the rain and smoke of years,
      it was as much as he could do to make out the forms of the different
      objects beyond, without making any attempt to be seen or heard,&mdash;which
      he had as much chance of being, as if he had lived inside the ball of St.
      Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral.
    </p>
    <p>
      One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that evening,
      the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to evince some
      anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him justice, this
      was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with this end and
      aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in his toilet,
      straightway.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some
      faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those about
      him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the way of
      this proposal. So he at once expressed his readiness; and, kneeling on the
      floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he could take his foot
      in his laps, he applied himself to a process which Mr. Dawkins designated
      as &lsquo;japanning his trotter-cases.&rsquo; The phrase, rendered into plain English,
      signifieth, cleaning his boots.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational
      animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy attitude
      smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and having his
      boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of having taken
      them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to disturb his
      reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco that soothed
      the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer that mollified his
      thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce, with a spice of
      romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature. He looked down on
      Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief space; and then,
      raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said, half in abstraction,
      and half to Master Bates:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a pity it is he isn&rsquo;t a prig!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Master Charles Bates; &lsquo;he don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates. They
      both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose you don&rsquo;t even know what a prig is?&rsquo; said the Dodger
      mournfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I know that,&rsquo; replied Oliver, looking up. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a the&mdash;;
      you&rsquo;re one, are you not?&rsquo; inquired Oliver, checking himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; replied the Dodger. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d scorn to be anything else.&rsquo; Mr. Dawkins
      gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment, and looked
      at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged by his saying
      anything to the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; repeated the Dodger. &lsquo;So&rsquo;s Charley. So&rsquo;s Fagin. So&rsquo;s Sikes. So&rsquo;s
      Nancy. So&rsquo;s Bet. So we all are, down to the dog. And he&rsquo;s the downiest one
      of the lot!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the least given to peaching,&rsquo; added Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He wouldn&rsquo;t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing
      himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without
      wittles for a fortnight,&rsquo; said the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; observed Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a rum dog. Don&rsquo;t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs or
      sings when he&rsquo;s in company!&rsquo; pursued the Dodger. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t he growl at all,
      when he hears a fiddle playing! And don&rsquo;t he hate other dogs as ain&rsquo;t of
      his breed! Oh, no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s an out-and-out Christian,&rsquo; said Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal&rsquo;s abilities, but it
      was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only known
      it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to be
      out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes&rsquo; dog, there exist
      strong and singular points of resemblance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they had
      strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced all his
      proceedings. &lsquo;This hasn&rsquo;t go anything to do with young Green here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more it has,&rsquo; said Charley. &lsquo;Why don&rsquo;t you put yourself under Fagin,
      Oliver?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And make your fortun&rsquo; out of hand?&rsquo; added the Dodger, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I mean
      to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the
      forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,&rsquo; said Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t like it,&rsquo; rejoined Oliver, timidly; &lsquo;I wish they would let me go.
      I&mdash;I&mdash;would rather go.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Fagin would <i>rather</i> not!&rsquo; rejoined Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to express
      his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his
      boot-cleaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go!&rsquo; exclaimed the Dodger. &lsquo;Why, where&rsquo;s your spirit?&rsquo; Don&rsquo;t you take any
      pride out of yourself? Would you go and be dependent on your friends?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, blow that!&rsquo; said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk
      handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s
      too mean; that is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> couldn&rsquo;t do it,&rsquo; said the Dodger, with an air of haughty
      disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can leave your friends, though,&rsquo; said Oliver with a half smile; &lsquo;and
      let them be punished for what you did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, &lsquo;That was all out of
      consideration for Fagin, &lsquo;cause the traps know that we work together, and
      he might have got into trouble if we hadn&rsquo;t made our lucky; that was the
      move, wasn&rsquo;t it, Charley?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection of
      Oliver&rsquo;s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was inhaling
      got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and down into his
      throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping, about five minutes
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look here!&rsquo; said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and
      halfpence. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a jolly life! What&rsquo;s the odds where it comes from?
      Here, catch hold; there&rsquo;s plenty more where they were took from. You
      won&rsquo;t, won&rsquo;t you? Oh, you precious flat!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s naughty, ain&rsquo;t it, Oliver?&rsquo; inquired Charley Bates. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll come to
      be scragged, won&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that means,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something in this way, old feller,&rsquo; said Charly. As he said it, Master
      Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect in the
      air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious sound through
      his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic representation, that
      scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what it means,&rsquo; said Charley. &lsquo;Look how he stares, Jack!
    </p>
    <p>
      I never did see such prime company as that &lsquo;ere boy; he&rsquo;ll be the death of
      me, I know he will.&rsquo; Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily again,
      resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been brought up bad,&rsquo; said the Dodger, surveying his boots with
      much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. &lsquo;Fagin will make
      something of you, though, or you&rsquo;ll be the first he ever had that turned
      out unprofitable. You&rsquo;d better begin at once; for you&rsquo;ll come to the trade
      long before you think of it; and you&rsquo;re only losing time, Oliver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his own:
      which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched into a
      glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the life they
      led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the best thing he
      could do, would be to secure Fagin&rsquo;s favour without more delay, by the
      means which they themselves had employed to gain it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,&rsquo; said the Dodger, as the Jew was
      heard unlocking the door above, &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t take fogels and tickers&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good of talking in that way?&rsquo; interposed Master Bates; &lsquo;he
      don&rsquo;t know what you mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you don&rsquo;t take pocket-handkechers and watches,&rsquo; said the Dodger,
      reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver&rsquo;s capacity, &lsquo;some other
      cove will; so that the coves that lose &lsquo;em will be all the worse, and
      you&rsquo;ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha&rsquo;p&rsquo;orth the better,
      except the chaps wot gets them&mdash;and you&rsquo;ve just as good a right to
      them as they have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure, to be sure!&rsquo; said the Jew, who had entered unseen by Oliver.
      &lsquo;It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the Dodger&rsquo;s word
      for it. Ha! ha! ha! He understands the catechism of his trade.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the
      Dodger&rsquo;s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his
      pupil&rsquo;s proficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had
      returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver had
      never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom Chitling; and
      who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few gallantries with the
      lady, now made his appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps numbered
      eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his deportment
      towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that he felt himself
      conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius and professional
      aquirements. He had small twinkling eyes, and a pock-marked face; wore a
      fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy fustian trousers, and an apron.
      His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out of repair; but he excused himself
      to the company by stating that his &lsquo;time&rsquo; was only out an hour before; and
      that, in consequence of having worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he
      had not been able to bestow any attention on his private clothes. Mr.
      Chitling added, with strong marks of irritation, that the new way of
      fumigating clothes up yonder was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt
      holes in them, and there was no remedy against the County. The same remark
      he considered to apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which
      he held to be decidedly unlawful. Mr. Chitling wound up his observations
      by stating that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral
      long hard-working days; and that he &lsquo;wished he might be busted if he
      warn&rsquo;t as dry as a lime-basket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?&rsquo; inquired the
      Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at
      Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A young friend of mine, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s in luck, then,&rsquo; said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.
      &lsquo;Never mind where I came from, young &lsquo;un; you&rsquo;ll find your way there, soon
      enough, I&rsquo;ll bet a crown!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this sally, the boys laughed. After some more jokes on the same
      subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew their
      chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and sit by
      him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to interest his
      hearers. These were, the great advantages of the trade, the proficiency of
      the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the liberality of the Jew
      himself. At length these subjects displayed signs of being thoroughly
      exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same: for the house of correction
      becomes fatiguing after a week or two. Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew;
      and left the party to their repose.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost
      constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with the
      Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver&rsquo;s, Mr. Fagin
      best knew. At other times the old man would tell them stories of robberies
      he had committed in his younger days: mixed up with so much that was droll
      and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing heartily, and showing
      that he was amused in spite of all his better feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils. Having prepared his
      mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the companionship of
      his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was now slowly instilling
      into his soul the poison which he hoped would blacken it, and change its
      hue for ever.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIX &mdash; IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his great-coat
      tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up over his ears
      so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face: emerged from his
      den. He paused on the step as the door was locked and chained behind him;
      and having listened while the boys made all secure, and until their
      retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down the street as
      quickly as he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of
      Whitechapel. The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the street;
      and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck off in the
      direction of the Spitalfields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the streets;
      the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and clammy to the
      touch. It seemed just the night when it befitted such a being as the Jew
      to be abroad. As he glided stealthily along, creeping beneath the shelter
      of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man seemed like some loathsome
      reptile, engendered in the slime and darkness through which he moved:
      crawling forth, by night, in search of some rich offal for a meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he
      reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon
      became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in
      that close and densely-populated quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be at
      all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the intricacies of
      the way. He hurried through several alleys and streets, and at length
      turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the farther end. At the
      door of a house in this street, he knocked; having exchanged a few
      muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man&rsquo;s voice
      demanded who was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew looking in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bring in your body then,&rsquo; said Sikes. &lsquo;Lie down, you stupid brute! Don&rsquo;t
      you know the devil when he&rsquo;s got a great-coat on?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin&rsquo;s outer
      garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a
      chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen: wagging his tail
      as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his nature
      to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew.&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! Nancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to
      imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had not
      met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver. All doubts upon the
      subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady&rsquo;s
      behaviour. She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair, and
      bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it: for it was a cold
      night, and no mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is cold, Nancy dear,&rsquo; said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands over
      the fire. &lsquo;It seems to go right through one,&rsquo; added the old man, touching
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Sikes. &lsquo;Give him something to drink, Nancy. Burn my body, make haste! It&rsquo;s
      enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase shivering in that
      way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were many:
      which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were filled with
      several kinds of liquids. Sikes pouring out a glass of brandy, bade the
      Jew drink it off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite enough, quite, thankee, Bill,&rsquo; replied the Jew, putting down the
      glass after just setting his lips to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! You&rsquo;re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?&rsquo; inquired
      Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew. &lsquo;Ugh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw the
      remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony to
      filling it again for himself: which he did at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second
      glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a
      restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly furnished
      apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to induce the
      belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and with no more
      suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three heavy bludgeons
      which stood in a corner, and a &lsquo;life-preserver&rsquo; that hung over the
      chimney-piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said Sikes, smacking his lips. &lsquo;Now I&rsquo;m ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For business?&rsquo; inquired the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For business,&rsquo; replied Sikes; &lsquo;so say what you&rsquo;ve got to say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?&rsquo; said the Jew, drawing his chair
      forward, and speaking in a very low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Wot about it?&rsquo; inquired Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew. &lsquo;He knows what I mean,
      Nancy; don&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; sneered Mr. Sikes. &lsquo;Or he won&rsquo;t, and that&rsquo;s the same
      thing. Speak out, and call things by their right names; don&rsquo;t sit there,
      winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you warn&rsquo;t the
      very first that thought about the robbery. Wot d&rsquo;ye mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, Bill, hush!&rsquo; said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop this
      burst of indignation; &lsquo;somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody will hear
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let &lsquo;em hear!&rsquo; said Sikes; &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care.&rsquo; But as Mr. Sikes <i>did</i>
      care, on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew
      calmer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, there,&rsquo; said the Jew, coaxingly. &lsquo;It was only my caution, nothing
      more. Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to be done,
      Bill, eh? When is it to be done? Such plate, my dear, such plate!&rsquo; said
      the Jew: rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in a rapture of
      anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not at all,&rsquo; replied Sikes coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to be done at all!&rsquo; echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not at all,&rsquo; rejoined Sikes. &lsquo;At least it can&rsquo;t be a put-up job, as
      we expected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it hasn&rsquo;t been properly gone about,&rsquo; said the Jew, turning pale with
      anger. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t tell me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I will tell you,&rsquo; retorted Sikes. &lsquo;Who are you that&rsquo;s not to be told?
      I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place for a
      fortnight, and he can&rsquo;t get one of the servants in line.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you mean to tell me, Bill,&rsquo; said the Jew: softening as the other grew
      heated: &lsquo;that neither of the two men in the house can be got over?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I do mean to tell you so,&rsquo; replied Sikes. &lsquo;The old lady has had &lsquo;em
      these twenty years; and if you were to give &lsquo;em five hundred pound, they
      wouldn&rsquo;t be in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But do you mean to say, my dear,&rsquo; remonstrated the Jew, &lsquo;that the women
      can&rsquo;t be got over?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; replied Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not by flash Toby Crackit?&rsquo; said the Jew incredulously. &lsquo;Think what women
      are, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,&rsquo; replied Sikes. &lsquo;He says he&rsquo;s worn
      sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he&rsquo;s been
      loitering down there, and it&rsquo;s all of no use.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my
      dear,&rsquo; said the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So he did,&rsquo; rejoined Sikes, &lsquo;and they warn&rsquo;t of no more use than the
      other plant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew looked blank at this information. After ruminating for some
      minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said,
      with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared
      the game was up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And yet,&rsquo; said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s a sad
      thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes. &lsquo;Worse luck!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep thought,
      with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy perfectly
      demoniacal. Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time. Nancy, apparently
      fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her eyes fixed upon the
      fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fagin,&rsquo; said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed; &lsquo;is
      it worth fifty shiners extra, if it&rsquo;s safely done from the outside?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it a bargain?&rsquo; inquired Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, my dear, yes,&rsquo; rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every
      muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had
      awakened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew&rsquo;s hand, with some disdain,
      &lsquo;let it come off as soon as you like. Toby and me were over the
      garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and
      shutters. The crib&rsquo;s barred up at night like a jail; but there&rsquo;s one part
      we can crack, safe and softly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which is that, Bill?&rsquo; asked the Jew eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why,&rsquo; whispered Sikes, &lsquo;as you cross the lawn&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes?&rsquo; said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost
      starting out of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Umph!&rsquo; cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her
      head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew&rsquo;s face.
      &lsquo;Never mind which part it is. You can&rsquo;t do it without me, I know; but it&rsquo;s
      best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you like, my dear, as you like&rsquo; replied the Jew. &lsquo;Is there no help
      wanted, but yours and Toby&rsquo;s?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None,&rsquo; said Sikes. &lsquo;Cept a centre-bit and a boy. The first we&rsquo;ve both
      got; the second you must find us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A boy!&rsquo; exclaimed the Jew. &lsquo;Oh! then it&rsquo;s a panel, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind wot it is!&rsquo; replied Sikes. &lsquo;I want a boy, and he musn&rsquo;t be a
      big &lsquo;un. Lord!&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, &lsquo;if I&rsquo;d only got that young
      boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper&rsquo;s! He kept him small on purpose, and let
      him out by the job. But the father gets lagged; and then the Juvenile
      Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from a trade where he was
      earning money, teaches him to read and write, and in time makes a
      &lsquo;prentice of him. And so they go on,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, his wrath rising
      with the recollection of his wrongs, &lsquo;so they go on; and, if they&rsquo;d got
      money enough (which it&rsquo;s a Providence they haven&rsquo;t,) we shouldn&rsquo;t have
      half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year or two.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more we should,&rsquo; acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering during
      this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. &lsquo;Bill!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What now?&rsquo; inquired Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the fire;
      and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave the room.
      Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought the precaution
      unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting Miss Nancy to fetch
      him a jug of beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t want any beer,&rsquo; said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining her
      seat very composedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you I do!&rsquo; replied Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nonsense,&rsquo; rejoined the girl coolly, &lsquo;Go on, Fagin. I know what he&rsquo;s
      going to say, Bill; he needn&rsquo;t mind me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew still hesitated. Sikes looked from one to the other in some
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?&rsquo; he asked at length.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil&rsquo;s in it. She
      ain&rsquo;t one to blab. Are you Nancy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> should think not!&rsquo; replied the young lady: drawing her chair up
      to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, my dear, I know you&rsquo;re not,&rsquo; said the Jew; &lsquo;but&mdash;&rsquo; and again
      the old man paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But wot?&rsquo; inquired Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know whether she mightn&rsquo;t p&rsquo;r&rsquo;aps be out of sorts, you know, my
      dear, as she was the other night,&rsquo; replied the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing a
      glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst into
      sundry exclamations of &lsquo;Keep the game a-going!&rsquo; &lsquo;Never say die!&rsquo; and the
      like. These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both gentlemen; for
      the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and resumed his seat: as did
      Mr. Sikes likewise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Fagin,&rsquo; said Nancy with a laugh. &lsquo;Tell Bill at once, about Oliver!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! you&rsquo;re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!&rsquo; said the
      Jew, patting her on the neck. &lsquo;It <i>was</i> about Oliver I was going to
      speak, sure enough. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What about him?&rsquo; demanded Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s the boy for you, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper;
      laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He!&rsquo; exclaimed. Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have him, Bill!&rsquo; said Nancy. &lsquo;I would, if I was in your place. He mayn&rsquo;t
      be so much up, as any of the others; but that&rsquo;s not what you want, if he&rsquo;s
      only to open a door for you. Depend upon it he&rsquo;s a safe one, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know he is,&rsquo; rejoined Fagin. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been in good training these last few
      weeks, and it&rsquo;s time he began to work for his bread. Besides, the others
      are all too big.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, he is just the size I want,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,&rsquo; interposed the Jew; &lsquo;he
      can&rsquo;t help himself. That is, if you frighten him enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Frighten him!&rsquo; echoed Sikes. &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll be no sham frightening, mind you. If
      there&rsquo;s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in for a
      penny, in for a pound. You won&rsquo;t see him alive again, Fagin. Think of
      that, before you send him. Mark my words!&rsquo; said the robber, poising a
      crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve thought of it all,&rsquo; said the Jew with energy. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve&mdash;I&rsquo;ve had
      my eye upon him, my dears, close&mdash;close. Once let him feel that he is
      one of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and
      he&rsquo;s ours! Ours for his life. Oho! It couldn&rsquo;t have come about better! The
      old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his head and
      shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ours!&rsquo; said Sikes. &lsquo;Yours, you mean.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I do, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. &lsquo;Mine, if
      you like, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And wot,&rsquo; said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, &lsquo;wot
      makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know
      there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you
      might pick and choose from?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because they&rsquo;re of no use to me, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew, with some
      confusion, &lsquo;not worth the taking. Their looks convict &lsquo;em when they get
      into trouble, and I lose &lsquo;em all. With this boy, properly managed, my
      dears, I could do what I couldn&rsquo;t with twenty of them. Besides,&rsquo; said the
      Jew, recovering his self-possession, &lsquo;he has us now if he could only give
      us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with us. Never mind how
      he came there; it&rsquo;s quite enough for my power over him that he was in a
      robbery; that&rsquo;s all I want. Now, how much better this is, than being
      obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the way&mdash;which would be
      dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When is it to be done?&rsquo; asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent exclamation
      on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with which he received
      Fagin&rsquo;s affectation of humanity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure,&rsquo; said the Jew; &lsquo;when is it to be done, Bill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,&rsquo; rejoined Sikes in a
      surly voice, &lsquo;if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said the Jew; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s no moon.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; rejoined Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?&rsquo; asked the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And about&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, ah, it&rsquo;s all planned,&rsquo; rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. &lsquo;Never mind
      particulars. You&rsquo;d better bring the boy here to-morrow night. I shall get
      off the stone an hour arter daybreak. Then you hold your tongue, and keep
      the melting-pot ready, and that&rsquo;s all you&rsquo;ll have to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was
      decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew&rsquo;s next evening when the night
      had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily observing,
      that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would be more
      willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in his
      behalf, than anybody else. It was also solemnly arranged that poor Oliver
      should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be unreservedly
      consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes; and further, that
      the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought fit; and should not be
      held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or evil that might be
      necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to render the compact in
      this respect binding, any representations made by Mr. Sikes on his return
      should be required to be confirmed and corroborated, in all important
      particulars, by the testimony of flash Toby Crackit.
    </p>
    <p>
      These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a
      furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner; yelling
      forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song, mingled with
      wild execrations. At length, in a fit of professional enthusiasm, he
      insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools: which he had no
      sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of explaining the
      nature and properties of the various implements it contained, and the
      peculiar beauties of their construction, than he fell over the box upon
      the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night, Nancy,&rsquo; said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly. There was no
      flinching about the girl. She was as true and earnest in the matter as
      Toby Crackit himself could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the
      prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Always the way!&rsquo; muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward. &lsquo;The
      worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call up some
      long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never lasts. Ha!
      ha! The man against the child, for a bag of gold!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended his
      way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode: where the Dodger was
      sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is Oliver a-bed? I want to speak to him,&rsquo; was his first remark as they
      descended the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hours ago,&rsquo; replied the Dodger, throwing open a door. &lsquo;Here he is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale with
      anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he looked like
      death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in the guise it
      wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle spirit has, but
      an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the world has not had
      time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; said the Jew, turning softly away. &lsquo;To-morrow. To-morrow.&rsquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XX &mdash; WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES
    </h2>
    <p>
      When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find
      that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at his
      bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was pleased
      with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of his release;
      but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting down to breakfast
      along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and manner which increased his
      alarm, that he was to be taken to the residence of Bill Sikes that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To&mdash;to&mdash;stop there, sir?&rsquo; asked Oliver, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, my dear. Not to stop there,&rsquo; replied the Jew. &lsquo;We shouldn&rsquo;t like
      to lose you. Don&rsquo;t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us again. Ha!
      ha! ha! We won&rsquo;t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear. Oh no, no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread,
      looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show that
      he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose,&rsquo; said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, &lsquo;you want to know
      what you&rsquo;re going to Bill&rsquo;s for&mdash;-eh, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been
      reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, do you think?&rsquo; inquired Fagin, parrying the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed I don&rsquo;t know, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from a
      close perusal of the boy&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Wait till Bill tells you, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver&rsquo;s not expressing any greater curiosity
      on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt very anxious,
      he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of Fagin&rsquo;s looks, and his
      own speculations, to make any further inquiries just then. He had no other
      opportunity: for the Jew remained very surly and silent till night: when
      he prepared to go abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may burn a candle,&rsquo; said the Jew, putting one upon the table. &lsquo;And
      here&rsquo;s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you. Good-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-night!&rsquo; replied Oliver, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he
      went. Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to light
      it. He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table, saw that
      the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and contracted brows,
      from the dark end of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take heed, Oliver! take heed!&rsquo; said the old man, shaking his right hand
      before him in a warning manner. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s a rough man, and thinks nothing of
      blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing; and do what he
      bids you. Mind!&rsquo; Placing a strong emphasis on the last word, he suffered
      his features gradually to resolve themselves into a ghastly grin, and,
      nodding his head, left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and
      pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard. The more
      he thought of the Jew&rsquo;s admonition, the more he was at a loss to divine
      its real purpose and meaning.
    </p>
    <p>
      He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes,
      which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin; and
      after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been selected to
      perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker, until another
      boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged. He was too well
      accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where he was, to bewail
      the prospect of change very severely. He remained lost in thought for some
      minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed the candle, and, taking up
      the book which the Jew had left with him, began to read.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned over the leaves. Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a passage
      which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the volume. It
      was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals; and the pages
      were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of dreadful crimes that
      made the blood run cold; of secret murders that had been committed by the
      lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye of man in deep pits and
      wells: which would not keep them down, deep as they were, but had yielded
      them up at last, after many years, and so maddened the murderers with the
      sight, that in their horror they had confessed their guilt, and yelled for
      the gibbet to end their agony. Here, too, he read of men who, lying in
      their beds at dead of night, had been tempted (so they said) and led on,
      by their own bad thoughts, to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh
      creep, and the limbs quail, to think of. The terrible descriptions were so
      real and vivid, that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and
      the words upon them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered,
      in hollow murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him.
      Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such
      deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved for
      crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm, and
      besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from his
      present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a poor
      outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it might
      come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in the midst
      of wickedness and guilt.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in
      his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that!&rsquo; he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure
      standing by the door. &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Me. Only me,&rsquo; replied a tremulous voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door. It
      was Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put down the light,&rsquo; said the girl, turning away her head. &lsquo;It hurts my
      eyes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill.
      The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him: and wrung
      her hands; but made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God forgive me!&rsquo; she cried after a while, &lsquo;I never thought of this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has anything happened?&rsquo; asked Oliver. &lsquo;Can I help you? I will if I can. I
      will, indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a gurgling
      sound, gasped for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nancy!&rsquo; cried Oliver, &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground; and,
      suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered with cold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver stirred the fire. Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there, for
      a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head, and
      looked round.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what comes over me sometimes,&rsquo; said she, affecting to busy
      herself in arranging her dress; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s this damp dirty room, I think. Now,
      Nolly, dear, are you ready?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I to go with you?&rsquo; asked Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. I have come from Bill,&rsquo; replied the girl. &lsquo;You are to go with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; asked Oliver, recoiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What for?&rsquo; echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again,
      the moment they encountered the boy&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Oh! For no harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t believe it,&rsquo; said Oliver: who had watched her closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have it your own way,&rsquo; rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. &lsquo;For no
      good, then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl&rsquo;s better feelings,
      and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion for his
      helpless state. But, then, the thought darted across his mind that it was
      barely eleven o&rsquo;clock; and that many people were still in the streets: of
      whom surely some might be found to give credence to his tale. As the
      reflection occured to him, he stepped forward: and said, somewhat hastily,
      that he was ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his
      companion. She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a look
      of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what had been
      passing in his thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as she
      looked cautiously round. &lsquo;You can&rsquo;t help yourself. I have tried hard for
      you, but all to no purpose. You are hedged round and round. If ever you
      are to get loose from here, this is not the time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with
      great surprise. She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was white
      and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do
      now,&rsquo; continued the girl aloud; &lsquo;for those who would have fetched you, if
      I had not, would have been far more rough than me. I have promised for
      your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm to
      yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death. See here! I have borne all
      this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and
      continued, with great rapidity:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember this! And don&rsquo;t let me suffer more for you, just now. If I could
      help you, I would; but I have not the power. They don&rsquo;t mean to harm you;
      whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours. Hush! Every word from you
      is a blow for me. Give me your hand. Make haste! Your hand!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and,
      blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was
      opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as quickly
      closed, when they had passed out. A hackney-cabriolet was in waiting; with
      the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing Oliver, the girl
      pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close. The driver wanted no
      directions, but lashed his horse into full speed, without the delay of an
      instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into
      his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted. All was so
      quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he was, or
      how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to which the
      Jew&rsquo;s steps had been directed on the previous evening.
    </p>
    <p>
      For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty street,
      and a cry for help hung upon his lips. But the girl&rsquo;s voice was in his
      ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her, that he had
      not the heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the opportunity was gone;
      he was already in the house, and the door was shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way,&rsquo; said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time. &lsquo;Bill!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a
      candle. &lsquo;Oh! That&rsquo;s the time of day. Come on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty
      welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes&rsquo; temperament. Nancy, appearing much
      gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bull&rsquo;s-eye&rsquo;s gone home with Tom,&rsquo; observed Sikes, as he lighted them up.
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;d have been in the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; rejoined Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you&rsquo;ve got the kid,&rsquo; said Sikes when they had all reached the room:
      closing the door as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, here he is,&rsquo; replied Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he come quiet?&rsquo; inquired Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like a lamb,&rsquo; rejoined Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad to hear it,&rsquo; said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; &lsquo;for the sake
      of his young carcase: as would otherways have suffered for it. Come here,
      young &lsquo;un; and let me read you a lectur&rsquo;, which is as well got over at
      once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver&rsquo;s cap and threw
      it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat himself down
      by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, first: do you know wot this is?&rsquo; inquired Sikes, taking up a
      pocket-pistol which lay on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver replied in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then, look here,&rsquo; continued Sikes. &lsquo;This is powder; that &lsquo;ere&rsquo;s a
      bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin&rsquo;.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to; and
      Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and
      deliberation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now it&rsquo;s loaded,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I see it is, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the robber, grasping Oliver&rsquo;s wrist, and putting the barrel
      so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the boy could
      not repress a start; &lsquo;if you speak a word when you&rsquo;re out o&rsquo;doors with me,
      except when I speak to you, that loading will be in your head without
      notice. So, if you <i>do</i> make up your mind to speak without leave, say
      your prayers first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase its
      effect, Mr. Sikes continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As near as I know, there isn&rsquo;t anybody as would be asking very partickler
      arter you, if you <i>was</i> disposed of; so I needn&rsquo;t take this
      devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn&rsquo;t for your
      own good. D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The short and the long of what you mean,&rsquo; said Nancy: speaking very
      emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his serious
      attention to her words: &lsquo;is, that if you&rsquo;re crossed by him in this job you
      have on hand, you&rsquo;ll prevent his ever telling tales afterwards, by
      shooting him through the head, and will take your chance of swinging for
      it, as you do for a great many other things in the way of business, every
      month of your life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it!&rsquo; observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; &lsquo;women can always put things
      in fewest words.&mdash;Except when it&rsquo;s blowing up; and then they
      lengthens it out. And now that he&rsquo;s thoroughly up to it, let&rsquo;s have some
      supper, and get a snooze before starting.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth; disappearing
      for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of porter and a dish
      of sheep&rsquo;s heads: which gave occasion to several pleasant witticisms on
      the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular coincidence of &lsquo;jemmies&rsquo; 
      being a can name, common to them, and also to an ingenious implement much
      used in his profession. Indeed, the worthy gentleman, stimulated perhaps
      by the immediate prospect of being on active service, was in great spirits
      and good humour; in proof whereof, it may be here remarked, that he
      humourously drank all the beer at a draught, and did not utter, on a rough
      calculation, more than four-score oaths during the whole progress of the
      meal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Supper being ended&mdash;it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no
      great appetite for it&mdash;Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of
      spirits and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many
      imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely. Oliver
      stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on a
      mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before it, in
      readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy
      might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the
      girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to trim
      the light. Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was
      thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which hung
      over the back of a chair. Nancy was busily engaged in preparing breakfast.
      It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning, and it was
      quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against the
      window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, then!&rsquo; growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; &lsquo;half-past five! Look
      sharp, or you&rsquo;ll get no breakfast; for it&rsquo;s late as it is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast, he
      replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite ready.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie round
      his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his
      shoulders. Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely
      pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same pistol
      in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his, and,
      exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope of
      meeting a look from the girl. But she had resumed her old seat in front of
      the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI &mdash; THE EXPEDITION
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and
      raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy. The night had been
      very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the kennels
      were overflowing. There was a faint glimmering of the coming day in the
      sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the scene: the
      sombre light only serving to pale that which the street lamps afforded,
      without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the wet house-tops, and
      dreary streets. There appeared to be nobody stirring in that quarter of
      the town; the windows of the houses were all closely shut; and the streets
      through which they passed, were noiseless and empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had
      fairly begun to break. Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a few
      country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and then, a
      stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver bestowing,
      as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner who, by keeping
      on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his arriving at the office,
      a quarter of a minute after his time. The public-houses, with gas-lights
      burning inside, were already open. By degrees, other shops began to be
      unclosed, and a few scattered people were met with. Then, came straggling
      groups of labourers going to their work; then, men and women with
      fish-baskets on their heads; donkey-carts laden with vegetables;
      chaise-carts filled with live-stock or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women
      with pails; an unbroken concourse of people, trudging out with various
      supplies to the eastern suburbs of the town. As they approached the City,
      the noise and traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets
      between Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and
      bustle. It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on again,
      and the busy morning of half the London population had begun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square,
      Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into
      Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a tumult
      of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was market-morning. The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with
      filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking bodies
      of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest upon the
      chimney-tops, hung heavily above. All the pens in the centre of the large
      area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into the vacant
      space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the gutter side were
      long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep. Countrymen, butchers,
      drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and vagabonds of every low grade,
      were mingled together in a mass; the whistling of drovers, the barking
      dogs, the bellowing and plunging of the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the
      grunting and squeaking of pigs, the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths,
      and quarrelling on all sides; the ringing of bells and roar of voices,
      that issued from every public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving,
      beating, whooping and yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that
      resounded from every corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven,
      squalid, and dirty figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in
      and out of the throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which
      quite confounded the senses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the thickest
      of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the numerous sights
      and sounds, which so astonished the boy. He nodded, twice or thrice, to a
      passing friend; and, resisting as many invitations to take a morning dram,
      pressed steadily onward, until they were clear of the turmoil, and had
      made their way through Hosier Lane into Holborn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, young &lsquo;un!&rsquo; said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew&rsquo;s
      Church, &lsquo;hard upon seven! you must step out. Come, don&rsquo;t lag behind
      already, Lazy-legs!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion&rsquo;s
      wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast walk
      and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as well as
      he could.
    </p>
    <p>
      They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park
      corner, and were on their way to Kensington: when Sikes relaxed his pace,
      until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind, came up.
      Seeing &lsquo;Hounslow&rsquo; written on it, he asked the driver with as much civility
      as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far as Isleworth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jump up,&rsquo; said the man. &lsquo;Is that your boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; he&rsquo;s my boy,&rsquo; replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting his
      hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your father walks rather too quick for you, don&rsquo;t he, my man?&rsquo; inquired
      the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; replied Sikes, interposing. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s used to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, take hold of my hand, Ned. In with you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver,
      pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and more,
      where his companion meant to take him. Kensington, Hammersmith, Chiswick,
      Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on as steadily
      as if they had only just begun their journey. At length, they came to a
      public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way beyond which,
      another road appeared to run off. And here, the cart stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand all
      the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look upon
      him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good-bye, boy,&rsquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s sulky,&rsquo; replied Sikes, giving him a shake; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s sulky. A young dog!
      Don&rsquo;t mind him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I!&rsquo; rejoined the other, getting into his cart. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a fine day,
      after all.&rsquo; And he drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he might
      look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and
      then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many
      large gardens and gentlemen&rsquo;s houses on both sides of the way, and
      stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town. Here
      against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large
      letters, &lsquo;Hampton.&rsquo; They lingered about, in the fields, for some hours. At
      length they came back into the town; and, turning into an old public-house
      with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the kitchen fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the
      middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the fire;
      on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking and
      smoking. They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes; and, as
      Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade sat in a
      corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their company.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr.
      Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to feel
      quite certain they were not going any further. Being much tired with the
      walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first; then, quite
      overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing
      himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy in
      close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint of
      ale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So, you&rsquo;re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?&rsquo; inquired Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I am,&rsquo; replied the man, who seemed a little the worse&mdash;or
      better, as the case might be&mdash;for drinking; &lsquo;and not slow about it
      neither. My horse hasn&rsquo;t got a load behind him going back, as he had
      coming up in the mornin&rsquo;; and he won&rsquo;t be long a-doing of it. Here&rsquo;s luck
      to him. Ecod! he&rsquo;s a good &lsquo;un!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?&rsquo; demanded Sikes,
      pushing the ale towards his new friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you&rsquo;re going directly, I can,&rsquo; replied the man, looking out of the
      pot. &lsquo;Are you going to Halliford?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Going on to Shepperton,&rsquo; replied Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m your man, as far as I go,&rsquo; replied the other. &lsquo;Is all paid, Becky?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, the other gentleman&rsquo;s paid,&rsquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say!&rsquo; said the man, with tipsy gravity; &lsquo;that won&rsquo;t do, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; rejoined Sikes. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a-going to accommodate us, and wot&rsquo;s to
      prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face;
      having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand: and declared he was a real
      good fellow. To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he had been
      sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company
      good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as
      they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see the
      party start.
    </p>
    <p>
      The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing
      outside: ready harnessed to the cart. Oliver and Sikes got in without any
      further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered for a
      minute or two &lsquo;to bear him up,&rsquo; and to defy the hostler and the world to
      produce his equal, mounted also. Then, the hostler was told to give the
      horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a very unpleasant
      use of it: tossing it into the air with great disdain, and running into
      the parlour windows over the way; after performing those feats, and
      supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs, he started off at
      great speed, and rattled out of the town right gallantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was very dark. A damp mist rose from the river, and the marshy
      ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields. It was piercing
      cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken; for the driver
      had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him into conversation.
      Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the cart; bewildered with
      alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange objects in the gaunt trees,
      whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as if in some fantastic joy at the
      desolation of the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven. There was a light
      in the ferry-house window opposite: which streamed across the road, and
      threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves beneath it.
      There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and the leaves of the
      old tree stirred gently in the night wind. It seemed like quiet music for
      the repose of the dead.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road. Two
      or three miles more, and the cart stopped. Sikes alighted, took Oliver by
      the hand, and they once again walked on.
    </p>
    <p>
      They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected;
      but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes and
      over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights of a
      town at no great distance. On looking intently forward, Oliver saw that
      the water was just below them, and that they were coming to the foot of a
      bridge.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then turned
      suddenly down a bank upon the left.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The water!&rsquo; thought Oliver, turning sick with fear. &lsquo;He has brought me to
      this lonely place to murder me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for his
      young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house: all
      ruinous and decayed. There was a window on each side of the dilapidated
      entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible. The house was
      dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes, with Oliver&rsquo;s hand still in his, softly approached the low porch,
      and raised the latch. The door yielded to the pressure, and they passed in
      together.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXII &mdash; THE BURGLARY
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the
      passage.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t make such a row,&rsquo; said Sikes, bolting the door. &lsquo;Show a glim,
      Toby.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha! my pal!&rsquo; cried the same voice. &lsquo;A glim, Barney, a glim! Show the
      gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the
      person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers: for the noise of a
      wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct
      muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear?&rsquo; cried the same voice. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Bill Sikes in the passage
      with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as if you took
      laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger. Are you any fresher now,
      or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you thoroughly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the
      room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on the
      right hand; first, a feeble candle: and next, the form of the same
      individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the
      infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at the
      public-house on Saffron Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bister Sikes!&rsquo; exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; &lsquo;cub id,
      sir; cub id.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here! you get on first,&rsquo; said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him.
      &lsquo;Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him; and
      they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken
      chairs, a table, and a very old couch: on which, with his legs much higher
      than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long clay
      pipe. He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with large
      brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring, shawl-pattern
      waistcoat; and drab breeches. Mr. Crackit (for he it was) had no very
      great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face; but what he had, was
      of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew curls, through which he
      occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers, ornamented with large common
      rings. He was a trifle above the middle size, and apparently rather weak
      in the legs; but this circumstance by no means detracted from his own
      admiration of his top-boots, which he contemplated, in their elevated
      situation, with lively satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bill, my boy!&rsquo; said this figure, turning his head towards the door, &lsquo;I&rsquo;m
      glad to see you. I was almost afraid you&rsquo;d given it up: in which case I
      should have made a personal wentur. Hallo!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes rested
      on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting posture, and
      demanded who that was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy. Only the boy!&rsquo; replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wud of Bister Fagid&rsquo;s lads,&rsquo; exclaimed Barney, with a grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fagin&rsquo;s, eh!&rsquo; exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver. &lsquo;Wot an inwalable boy
      that&rsquo;ll make, for the old ladies&rsquo; pockets in chapels! His mug is a fortin&rsquo; 
      to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&mdash;there&rsquo;s enough of that,&rsquo; interposed Sikes, impatiently; and
      stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his ear:
      at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with a long
      stare of astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll give us something to
      eat and drink while we&rsquo;re waiting, you&rsquo;ll put some heart in us; or in me,
      at all events. Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest yourself; for
      you&rsquo;ll have to go out with us again to-night, though not very far off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool to
      the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing where
      he was, or what was passing around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and a
      bottle upon the table, &lsquo;Success to the crack!&rsquo; He rose to honour the
      toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner, advanced to
      the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its contents. Mr.
      Sikes did the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A drain for the boy,&rsquo; said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. &lsquo;Down with
      it, innocence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed,&rsquo; said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man&rsquo;s face; &lsquo;indeed,
      I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Down with it!&rsquo; echoed Toby. &lsquo;Do you think I don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s good for
      you? Tell him to drink it, Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had better!&rsquo; said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. &lsquo;Burn my
      body, if he isn&rsquo;t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers. Drink it,
      you perwerse imp; drink it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily
      swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a violent
      fit of coughing: which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and even drew a
      smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat
      nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the two
      men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap. Oliver retained his
      stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched himself on the
      floor: close outside the fender.
    </p>
    <p>
      They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but
      Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell
      into a heavy doze: imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes, or
      wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other of the
      scenes of the past day: when he was roused by Toby Crackit jumping up and
      declaring it was half-past one.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively
      engaged in busy preparation. Sikes and his companion enveloped their necks
      and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats; Barney,
      opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he hastily
      crammed into the pockets.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Barkers for me, Barney,&rsquo; said Toby Crackit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here they are,&rsquo; replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. &lsquo;You loaded
      them yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right!&rsquo; replied Toby, stowing them away. &lsquo;The persuaders?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got &lsquo;em,&rsquo; replied Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies&mdash;nothing forgotten?&rsquo; inquired
      Toby: fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; rejoined his companion. &lsquo;Bring them bits of timber, Barney.
      That&rsquo;s the time of day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney&rsquo;s hands, who, having
      delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on Oliver&rsquo;s cape.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now then!&rsquo; said Sikes, holding out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver: who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the
      air, and the drink which had been forced upon him: put his hand
      mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take his other hand, Toby,&rsquo; said Sikes. &lsquo;Look out, Barney.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet. The
      two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having made all
      fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now intensely dark. The fog was much heavier than it had been in
      the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that,
      although no rain fell, Oliver&rsquo;s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes
      after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture
      that was floating about. They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards the
      lights which he had seen before. They were at no great distance off; and,
      as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Slap through the town,&rsquo; whispered Sikes; &lsquo;there&rsquo;ll be nobody in the way,
      to-night, to see us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little
      town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted. A dim light shone at
      intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs
      occasionally broke the silence of the night. But there was nobody abroad.
      They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two.
    </p>
    <p>
      Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After
      walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house
      surrounded by a wall: to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely pausing
      to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy next,&rsquo; said Toby. &lsquo;Hoist him up; I&rsquo;ll catch hold of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the arms;
      and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass on the
      other side. Sikes followed directly. And they stole cautiously towards the
      house.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and terror,
      saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the objects of the
      expedition. He clasped his hands together, and involuntarily uttered a
      subdued exclamation of horror. A mist came before his eyes; the cold sweat
      stood upon his ashy face; his limbs failed him; and he sank upon his
      knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get up!&rsquo; murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol from
      his pocket; &lsquo;Get up, or I&rsquo;ll strew your brains upon the grass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! for God&rsquo;s sake let me go!&rsquo; cried Oliver; &lsquo;let me run away and die in
      the fields. I will never come near London; never, never! Oh! pray have
      mercy on me, and do not make me steal. For the love of all the bright
      Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had
      cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his hand
      upon the boy&rsquo;s mouth, and dragged him to the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; cried the man; &lsquo;it won&rsquo;t answer here. Say another word, and I&rsquo;ll
      do your business myself with a crack on the head. That makes no noise, and
      is quite as certain, and more genteel. Here, Bill, wrench the shutter
      open. He&rsquo;s game enough now, I&rsquo;ll engage. I&rsquo;ve seen older hands of his age
      took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin&rsquo;s head for sending Oliver
      on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little noise.
      After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to which he
      had referred, swung open on its hinges.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the
      ground, at the back of the house: which belonged to a scullery, or small
      brewing-place, at the end of the passage. The aperture was so small, that
      the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to defend it more
      securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of Oliver&rsquo;s size,
      nevertheless. A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike&rsquo;s art, sufficed to
      overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood wide open also.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now listen, you young limb,&rsquo; whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern from
      his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver&rsquo;s face; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m a going to
      put you through there. Take this light; go softly up the steps straight
      afore you, and along the little hall, to the street door; unfasten it, and
      let us in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a bolt at the top, you won&rsquo;t be able to reach,&rsquo; interposed Toby.
      &lsquo;Stand upon one of the hall chairs. There are three there, Bill, with a
      jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on &lsquo;em: which is the old
      lady&rsquo;s arms.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep quiet, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; replied Sikes, with a threatening look. &lsquo;The
      room-door is open, is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wide,&rsquo; replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. &lsquo;The game of
      that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog,
      who&rsquo;s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels
      wakeful. Ha! ha! Barney &lsquo;ticed him away to-night. So neat!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed
      without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get to
      work. Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it on the
      ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against the wall
      beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to make a step of
      his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting upon him, put
      Oliver gently through the window with his feet first; and, without leaving
      hold of his collar, planted him safely on the floor inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take this lantern,&rsquo; said Sikes, looking into the room. &lsquo;You see the
      stairs afore you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; Sikes, pointing to the
      street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take notice
      that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he would
      fall dead that instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s done in a minute,&rsquo; said Sikes, in the same low whisper. &lsquo;Directly I
      leave go of you, do your work. Hark!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; whispered the other man.
    </p>
    <p>
      They listened intently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver. &lsquo;Now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly
      resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one
      effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family. Filled with
      this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come back!&rsquo; suddenly cried Sikes aloud. &lsquo;Back! back!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and by a
      loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew not
      whether to advance or fly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cry was repeated&mdash;a light appeared&mdash;a vision of two
      terrified half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes&mdash;a
      flash&mdash;a loud noise&mdash;a smoke&mdash;a crash somewhere, but where
      he knew not,&mdash;and he staggered back.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0121.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him by
      the collar before the smoke had cleared away. He fired his own pistol
      after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Clasp your arm tighter,&rsquo; said Sikes, as he drew him through the window.
      &lsquo;Give me a shawl here. They&rsquo;ve hit him. Quick! How the boy bleeds!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of fire-arms,
      and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried over uneven
      ground at a rapid pace. And then, the noises grew confused in the
      distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy&rsquo;s heart; and he saw
      or heard no more.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIII &mdash; WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT
      CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR. BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE
      MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON SOME POINTS
    </h2>
    <p>
      The night was bitter cold. The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a hard
      thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways and
      corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad: which, as if
      expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it savagely up
      in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies, scattered it in
      air. Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night for the well-housed
      and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God they were at home; and
      for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him down and die. Many
      hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare streets, at such times,
      who, let their crimes have been what they may, can hardly open them in a
      more bitter world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the matron
      of the workhouse to which our readers have been already introduced as the
      birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a cheerful fire in her
      own little room, and glanced, with no small degree of complacency, at a
      small round table: on which stood a tray of corresponding size, furnished
      with all necessary materials for the most grateful meal that matrons
      enjoy. In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to solace herself with a cup of tea.
      As she glanced from the table to the fireplace, where the smallest of all
      possible kettles was singing a small song in a small voice, her inward
      satisfaction evidently increased,&mdash;so much so, indeed, that Mrs.
      Corney smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking
      reflectively at the fire; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m sure we have all on us a great deal to be
      grateful for! A great deal, if we did but know it. Ah!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental
      blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver
      spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin
      tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds! The
      black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs.
      Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drat the pot!&rsquo; said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on
      the hob; &lsquo;a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups! What
      use is it of, to anybody! Except,&rsquo; said Mrs. Corney, pausing, &lsquo;except to a
      poor desolate creature like me. Oh dear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more
      resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate. The small
      teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad recollections of
      Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than five-and-twenty years); and
      she was overpowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never get another!&rsquo; said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; &lsquo;I shall never
      get another&mdash;like him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is
      uncertain. It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it as
      she spoke; and took it up afterwards. She had just tasted her first cup,
      when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, come in with you!&rsquo; said Mrs. Corney, sharply. &lsquo;Some of the old women
      dying, I suppose. They always die when I&rsquo;m at meals. Don&rsquo;t stand there,
      letting the cold air in, don&rsquo;t. What&rsquo;s amiss now, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, ma&rsquo;am, nothing,&rsquo; replied a man&rsquo;s voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, &lsquo;is that Mr.
      Bumble?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At your service, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping outside
      to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and who now
      made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a bundle in
      the other. &lsquo;Shall I shut the door, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any impropriety
      in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors. Mr. Bumble
      taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold himself, shut it
      without permission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,&rsquo; said the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hard, indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied the beadle. &lsquo;Anti-porochial weather this,
      ma&rsquo;am. We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a matter of
      twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very blessed
      afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not. When would they be, Mr. Bumble?&rsquo; said the matron, sipping
      her tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When, indeed, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;Why here&rsquo;s one man that, in
      consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and a good
      pound of cheese, full weight. Is he grateful, ma&rsquo;am? Is he grateful? Not a
      copper farthing&rsquo;s worth of it! What does he do, ma&rsquo;am, but ask for a few
      coals; if it&rsquo;s only a pocket handkerchief full, he says! Coals! What would
      he do with coals? Toast his cheese with &lsquo;em and then come back for more.
      That&rsquo;s the way with these people, ma&rsquo;am; give &lsquo;em a apron full of coals
      to-day, and they&rsquo;ll come back for another, the day after to-morrow, as
      brazen as alabaster.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible simile;
      and the beadle went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, &lsquo;see anything like the pitch it&rsquo;s got to. The
      day afore yesterday, a man&mdash;you have been a married woman, ma&rsquo;am, and
      I may mention it to you&mdash;a man, with hardly a rag upon his back (here
      Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer&rsquo;s door when he has
      got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be relieved, Mrs. Corney.
      As he wouldn&rsquo;t go away, and shocked the company very much, our overseer
      sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a pint of oatmeal. &ldquo;My heart!&rdquo;
       says the ungrateful villain, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the use of <i>this</i> to me? You
      might as well give me a pair of iron spectacles!&rdquo; &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; says our
      overseer, taking &lsquo;em away again, &ldquo;you won&rsquo;t get anything else here.&rdquo; &ldquo;Then
      I&rsquo;ll die in the streets!&rdquo; says the vagrant. &ldquo;Oh no, you won&rsquo;t,&rdquo; says our
      overseer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha! That was very good! So like Mr. Grannett, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; interposed
      the matron. &lsquo;Well, Mr. Bumble?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; rejoined the beadle, &lsquo;he went away; and he <i>did</i> die
      in the streets. There&rsquo;s a obstinate pauper for you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It beats anything I could have believed,&rsquo; observed the matron
      emphatically. &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you think out-of-door relief a very bad thing,
      any way, Mr. Bumble? You&rsquo;re a gentleman of experience, and ought to know.
      Come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Corney,&rsquo; said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious of
      superior information, &lsquo;out-of-door relief, properly managed: properly
      managed, ma&rsquo;am: is the porochial safeguard. The great principle of
      out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what they don&rsquo;t want;
      and then they get tired of coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Corney. &lsquo;Well, that is a good one, too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Betwixt you and me, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; returned Mr. Bumble, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the great
      principle; and that&rsquo;s the reason why, if you look at any cases that get
      into them owdacious newspapers, you&rsquo;ll always observe that sick families
      have been relieved with slices of cheese. That&rsquo;s the rule now, Mrs.
      Corney, all over the country. But, however,&rsquo; said the beadle, stopping to
      unpack his bundle, &lsquo;these are official secrets, ma&rsquo;am; not to be spoken
      of; except, as I may say, among the porochial officers, such as ourselves.
      This is the port wine, ma&rsquo;am, that the board ordered for the infirmary;
      real, fresh, genuine port wine; only out of the cask this forenoon; clear
      as a bell, and no sediment!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to test
      its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of drawers;
      folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it carefully
      in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,&rsquo; said the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It blows, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar, &lsquo;enough
      to cut one&rsquo;s ears off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was moving
      towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to bidding her
      good-night, bashfully inquired whether&mdash;whether he wouldn&rsquo;t take a
      cup of tea?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat and
      stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table. As he slowly
      seated himself, he looked at the lady. She fixed her eyes upon the little
      teapot. Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she sat
      down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle; she
      coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea. Again Mr.
      Bumble coughed&mdash;louder this time than he had coughed yet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sweet? Mr. Bumble?&rsquo; inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very sweet, indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble. He fixed his eyes on Mrs.
      Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr. Bumble was
      that beadle at that moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The tea was made, and handed in silence. Mr. Bumble, having spread a
      handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the
      splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these amusements,
      occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had no injurious
      effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather seemed to
      facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a cat, ma&rsquo;am, I see,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who, in
      the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; &lsquo;and kittens too, I
      declare!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can&rsquo;t think,&rsquo; replied the matron.
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re <i>so</i> happy, <i>so</i> frolicsome, and <i>so</i> cheerful,
      that they are quite companions for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very nice animals, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; &lsquo;so very
      domestic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes!&rsquo; rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; &lsquo;so fond of their home
      too, that it&rsquo;s quite a pleasure, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Corney, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time with
      his teaspoon, &lsquo;I mean to say this, ma&rsquo;am; that any cat, or kitten, that
      could live with you, ma&rsquo;am, and <i>not</i> be fond of its home, must be a
      ass, ma&rsquo;am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Bumble!&rsquo; remonstrated Mrs. Corney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s of no use disguising facts, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, slowly
      flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him
      doubly impressive; &lsquo;I would drown it myself, with pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;re a cruel man,&rsquo; said the matron vivaciously, as she held out
      her hand for the beadle&rsquo;s cup; &lsquo;and a very hard-hearted man besides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hard-hearted, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;Hard?&rsquo; Mr. Bumble resigned his
      cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s little finger as she took
      it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced waistcoat, gave a
      mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little morsel farther from the
      fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been sitting
      opposite each other, with no great space between them, and fronting the
      fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from the fire, and
      still keeping at the table, increased the distance between himself and
      Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers will doubtless be
      disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great heroism on Mr.
      Bumble&rsquo;s part: he being in some sort tempted by time, place, and
      opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings, which however
      well they may become the lips of the light and thoughtless, do seem
      immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the land, members of
      parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other great public
      functionaries, but more particularly beneath the stateliness and gravity
      of a beadle: who (as is well known) should be the sternest and most
      inflexible among them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whatever were Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s intentions, however (and no doubt they were of
      the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before remarked,
      that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble, moving his chair
      by little and little, soon began to diminish the distance between himself
      and the matron; and, continuing to travel round the outer edge of the
      circle, brought his chair, in time, close to that in which the matron was
      seated.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0129.jpg" alt="0129 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0129.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have been
      scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen into Mr.
      Bumble&rsquo;s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt foreseeing these
      consequences at a glance) she remained where she was, and handed Mr.
      Bumble another cup of tea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and
      looking up into the matron&rsquo;s face; &lsquo;are <i>you</i> hard-hearted, Mrs.
      Corney?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me!&rsquo; exclaimed the matron, &lsquo;what a very curious question from a
      single man. What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast;
      whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately kissed
      the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bumble!&rsquo; cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was so
      great, that she had quite lost her voice, &lsquo;Mr. Bumble, I shall scream!&rsquo; 
      Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner, put his arm
      round the matron&rsquo;s waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would
      have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was
      rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door: which was no sooner
      heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine bottles, and
      began dusting them with great violence: while the matron sharply demanded
      who was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy of
      a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that her
      voice had quite recovered all its official asperity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you please, mistress,&rsquo; said a withered old female pauper, hideously
      ugly: putting her head in at the door, &lsquo;Old Sally is a-going fast.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, what&rsquo;s that to me?&rsquo; angrily demanded the matron. &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t keep her
      alive, can I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, mistress,&rsquo; replied the old woman, &lsquo;nobody can; she&rsquo;s far beyond
      the reach of help. I&rsquo;ve seen a many people die; little babes and great
      strong men; and I know when death&rsquo;s a-coming, well enough. But she&rsquo;s
      troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,&mdash;and that&rsquo;s
      not often, for she is dying very hard,&mdash;she says she has got
      something to tell, which you must hear. She&rsquo;ll never die quiet till you
      come, mistress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of
      invectives against old women who couldn&rsquo;t even die without purposely
      annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which she
      hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she came
      back, lest anything particular should occur. Bidding the messenger walk
      fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she followed her from
      the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable. He
      opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs, closely
      inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the genuine metal,
      and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put on his cocked hat
      corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four distinct times round the
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off the
      cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his back
      towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact inventory of
      the furniture.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIV &mdash; TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT. BUT IS A SHORT ONE,
      AND MAY BE FOUND OF IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the
      matron&rsquo;s room. Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with palsy;
      her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the grotesque
      shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! How few of Nature&rsquo;s faces are left alone to gladden us with their
      beauty! The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world, change them
      as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions sleep, and have
      lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass off, and leave
      Heaven&rsquo;s surface clear. It is a common thing for the countenances of the
      dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to subside into the
      long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and settle into the very
      look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they grow again, that those
      who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by the coffin&rsquo;s side in awe,
      and see the Angel even upon earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering
      some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at length
      compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand, and
      remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble superior
      made her way to the room where the sick woman lay.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end.
      There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish apothecary&rsquo;s
      apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick out of a quill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cold night, Mrs. Corney,&rsquo; said this young gentleman, as the matron
      entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very cold, indeed, sir,&rsquo; replied the mistress, in her most civil tones,
      and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should get better coals out of your contractors,&rsquo; said the
      apothecary&rsquo;s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the rusty
      poker; &lsquo;these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re the board&rsquo;s choosing, sir,&rsquo; returned the matron. &lsquo;The least they
      could do, would be to keep us pretty warm: for our places are hard
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said the young mag, turning his face towards the bed, as if he had
      previously quite forgotten the patient, &lsquo;it&rsquo;s all U.P. there, Mrs.
      Corney.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, is it, sir?&rsquo; asked the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,&rsquo; said the
      apothecary&rsquo;s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick&rsquo;s point. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a
      break-up of the system altogether. Is she dozing, old lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the
      affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then perhaps she&rsquo;ll go off in that way, if you don&rsquo;t make a row,&rsquo; said
      the young man. &lsquo;Put the light on the floor. She won&rsquo;t see it there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The attendant did as she was told: shaking her head meanwhile, to intimate
      that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she resumed her
      seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time returned. The
      mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped herself in her shawl,
      and sat at the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The apothecary&rsquo;s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the
      toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it
      for ten minutes or so: when apparently growing rather dull, he wished Mrs.
      Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from
      the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to
      catch the heat. The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled faces,
      and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position, they began
      to converse in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?&rsquo; inquired the
      messenger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a word,&rsquo; replied the other. &lsquo;She plucked and tore at her arms for a
      little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off. She hasn&rsquo;t
      much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet. I ain&rsquo;t so weak for an
      old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?&rsquo; demanded the
      first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tried to get it down,&rsquo; rejoined the other. &lsquo;But her teeth were tight
      set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I could do to
      get it back again. So I drank it; and it did me good!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard, the
      two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mind the time,&rsquo; said the first speaker, &lsquo;when she would have done the
      same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, that she would,&rsquo; rejoined the other; &lsquo;she had a merry heart. &lsquo;A many,
      many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as waxwork. My old
      eyes have seen them&mdash;ay, and those old hands touched them too; for I
      have helped her, scores of times.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature
      shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket, brought
      out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook a few
      grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few more into
      her own. While they were thus employed, the matron, who had been
      impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her stupor,
      joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to wait?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not long, mistress,&rsquo; replied the second woman, looking up into her face.
      &lsquo;We have none of us long to wait for Death. Patience, patience! He&rsquo;ll be
      here soon enough for us all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!&rsquo; said the matron sternly. &lsquo;You,
      Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Often,&rsquo; answered the first woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But will never be again,&rsquo; added the second one; &lsquo;that is, she&rsquo;ll never
      wake again but once&mdash;and mind, mistress, that won&rsquo;t be for long!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Long or short,&rsquo; said the matron, snappishly, &lsquo;she won&rsquo;t find me here when
      she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for nothing.
      It&rsquo;s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house die, and I
      won&rsquo;t&mdash;that&rsquo;s more. Mind that, you impudent old harridans. If you
      make a fool of me again, I&rsquo;ll soon cure you, I warrant you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned
      towards the bed, caused her to look round. The patient had raised herself
      upright, and was stretching her arms towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; she cried, in a hollow voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, hush!&rsquo; said one of the women, stooping over her. &lsquo;Lie down, lie
      down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never lie down again alive!&rsquo; said the woman, struggling. &lsquo;I <i>will</i>
      tell her! Come here! Nearer! Let me whisper in your ear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the
      bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of the
      two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Turn them away,&rsquo; said the woman, drowsily; &lsquo;make haste! make haste!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous
      lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best friends;
      and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never leave her,
      when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the door, and returned
      to the bedside. On being excluded, the old ladies changed their tone, and
      cried through the keyhole that old Sally was drunk; which, indeed, was not
      unlikely; since, in addition to a moderate dose of opium prescribed by the
      apothecary, she was labouring under the effects of a final taste of
      gin-and-water which had been privily administered, in the openness of
      their hearts, by the worthy old ladies themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now listen to me,&rsquo; said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great
      effort to revive one latent spark of energy. &lsquo;In this very room&mdash;in
      this very bed&mdash;I once nursed a pretty young creetur&rsquo;, that was
      brought into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all
      soiled with dust and blood. She gave birth to a boy, and died. Let me
      think&mdash;what was the year again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind the year,&rsquo; said the impatient auditor; &lsquo;what about her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay,&rsquo; murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state,
      &lsquo;what about her?&mdash;what about&mdash;I know!&rsquo; she cried, jumping
      fiercely up: her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head&mdash;&lsquo;I
      robbed her, so I did! She wasn&rsquo;t cold&mdash;I tell you she wasn&rsquo;t cold,
      when I stole it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stole what, for God&rsquo;s sake?&rsquo; cried the matron, with a gesture as if she
      would call for help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>It</i>!&rsquo; replied the woman, laying her hand over the other&rsquo;s mouth.
      &lsquo;The only thing she had. She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to
      eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom. It was gold, I
      tell you! Rich gold, that might have saved her life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gold!&rsquo; echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell
      back. &lsquo;Go on, go on&mdash;yes&mdash;what of it? Who was the mother? When
      was it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She charge me to keep it safe,&rsquo; replied the woman with a groan, &lsquo;and
      trusted me as the only woman about her. I stole it in my heart when she
      first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child&rsquo;s death, perhaps,
      is on me besides! They would have treated him better, if they had known it
      all!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Known what?&rsquo; asked the other. &lsquo;Speak!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy grew so like his mother,&rsquo; said the woman, rambling on, and not
      heeding the question, &lsquo;that I could never forget it when I saw his face.
      Poor girl! poor girl! She was so young, too! Such a gentle lamb! Wait;
      there&rsquo;s more to tell. I have not told you all, have I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as
      they came more faintly from the dying woman. &lsquo;Be quick, or it may be too
      late!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mother,&rsquo; said the woman, making a more violent effort than before;
      &lsquo;the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in my
      ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come when
      it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother named.
      &ldquo;And oh, kind Heaven!&rdquo; she said, folding her thin hands together, &ldquo;whether
      it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in this troubled world,
      and take pity upon a lonely desolate child, abandoned to its mercy!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy&rsquo;s name?&rsquo; demanded the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They <i>called</i> him Oliver,&rsquo; replied the woman, feebly. &lsquo;The gold I
      stole was&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes&mdash;what?&rsquo; cried the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew back,
      instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a sitting
      posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered some
      indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stone dead!&rsquo; said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the door
      was opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And nothing to tell, after all,&rsquo; rejoined the matron, walking carelessly
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the preparations
      for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left alone, hovering
      about the body.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXV &mdash; WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY
    </h2>
    <p>
      While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat in
      the old den&mdash;the same from which Oliver had been removed by the girl&mdash;brooding
      over a dull, smoky fire. He held a pair of bellows upon his knee, with
      which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it into more cheerful
      action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and with his arms folded on
      them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed his eyes, abstractedly, on
      the rusty bars.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and Mr.
      Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy against
      Master Bates and Mr. Chitling. The countenance of the first-named
      gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired great additional
      interest from his close observance of the game, and his attentive perusal
      of Mr. Chitling&rsquo;s hand; upon which, from time to time, as occasion served,
      he bestowed a variety of earnest glances: wisely regulating his own play
      by the result of his observations upon his neighbour&rsquo;s cards. It being a
      cold night, the Dodger wore his hat, as, indeed, was often his custom
      within doors. He also sustained a clay pipe between his teeth, which he
      only removed for a brief space when he deemed it necessary to apply for
      refreshment to a quart pot upon the table, which stood ready filled with
      gin-and-water for the accommodation of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more excitable
      nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that he more
      frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover indulged in
      many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a scientific
      rubber. Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close attachment, more
      than once took occasion to reason gravely with his companion upon these
      improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master Bates received in
      extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to be &lsquo;blowed,&rsquo; or to
      insert his head in a sack, or replying with some other neatly-turned
      witticism of a similar kind, the happy application of which, excited
      considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling. It was remarkable
      that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably lost; and that the
      circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates, appeared to afford him
      the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed most uproariously at the end
      of every deal, and protested that he had never seen such a jolly game in
      all his born days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s two doubles and the rub,&rsquo; said Mr. Chitling, with a very long
      face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket. &lsquo;I never see such
      a feller as you, Jack; you win everything. Even when we&rsquo;ve good cards,
      Charley and I can&rsquo;t make nothing of &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very
      ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of
      laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire what
      was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Matter, Fagin!&rsquo; cried Charley. &lsquo;I wish you had watched the play. Tommy
      Chitling hasn&rsquo;t won a point; and I went partners with him against the
      Artfull and dumb.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, ay!&rsquo; said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated that
      he was at no loss to understand the reason. &lsquo;Try &lsquo;em again, Tom; try &lsquo;em
      again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more of it for me, thank &lsquo;ee, Fagin,&rsquo; replied Mr. Chitling; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had
      enough. That &lsquo;ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there&rsquo;s no standing
      again&rsquo; him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha! my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew, &lsquo;you must get up very early in the
      morning, to win against the Dodger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Morning!&rsquo; said Charley Bates; &lsquo;you must put your boots on over-night, and
      have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your shoulders, if
      you want to come over him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy, and
      offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first picture-card, at a
      shilling at a time. Nobody accepting the challenge, and his pipe being by
      this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse himself by sketching a
      ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the piece of chalk which had
      served him in lieu of counters; whistling, meantime, with peculiar
      shrillness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How precious dull you are, Tommy!&rsquo; said the Dodger, stopping short when
      there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling. &lsquo;What do you
      think he&rsquo;s thinking of, Fagin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How should I know, my dear?&rsquo; replied the Jew, looking round as he plied
      the bellows. &lsquo;About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement in the
      country that he&rsquo;s just left, eh? Ha! ha! Is that it, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of discourse
      as Mr. Chitling was about to reply. &lsquo;What do <i>you</i> say, Charley?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> should say,&rsquo; replied Master Bates, with a grin, &lsquo;that he was
      uncommon sweet upon Betsy. See how he&rsquo;s a-blushing! Oh, my eye! here&rsquo;s a
      merry-go-rounder! Tommy Chitling&rsquo;s in love! Oh, Fagin, Fagin! what a
      spree!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim of
      the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair with such
      violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the floor; where
      (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at full length
      until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former position, and began
      another laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind him, my dear,&rsquo; said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and
      giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.
      &lsquo;Betsy&rsquo;s a fine girl. Stick up to her, Tom. Stick up to her.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What I mean to say, Fagin,&rsquo; replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the face,
      &lsquo;is, that that isn&rsquo;t anything to anybody here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No more it is,&rsquo; replied the Jew; &lsquo;Charley will talk. Don&rsquo;t mind him, my
      dear; don&rsquo;t mind him. Betsy&rsquo;s a fine girl. Do as she bids you, Tom, and
      you will make your fortune.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I <i>do</i> do as she bids me,&rsquo; replied Mr. Chitling; &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t
      have been milled, if it hadn&rsquo;t been for her advice. But it turned out a
      good job for you; didn&rsquo;t it, Fagin! And what&rsquo;s six weeks of it? It must
      come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when you don&rsquo;t
      want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You wouldn&rsquo;t mind it again, Tom, would you,&rsquo; asked the Dodger, winking
      upon Charley and the Jew, &lsquo;if Bet was all right?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean to say that I shouldn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Tom, angrily. &lsquo;There, now. Ah!
      Who&rsquo;ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew; &lsquo;not a soul, Tom. I don&rsquo;t know one of
      &lsquo;em that would do it besides you; not one of &lsquo;em, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might have got clear off, if I&rsquo;d split upon her; mightn&rsquo;t I, Fagin?&rsquo; 
      angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe. &lsquo;A word from me would have done
      it; wouldn&rsquo;t it, Fagin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure it would, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I didn&rsquo;t blab it; did I, Fagin?&rsquo; demanded Tom, pouring question upon
      question with great volubility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, to be sure,&rsquo; replied the Jew; &lsquo;you were too stout-hearted for
      that. A deal too stout, my dear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps I was,&rsquo; rejoined Tom, looking round; &lsquo;and if I was, what&rsquo;s to
      laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened to
      assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the
      company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender. But,
      unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never
      more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a
      violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary
      ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender; who,
      being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose his time
      so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old gentleman, and
      caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood panting for breath,
      while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; cried the Dodger at this moment, &lsquo;I heard the tinkler.&rsquo; Catching
      up the light, he crept softly upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in
      darkness. After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered Fagin
      mysteriously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried the Jew, &lsquo;alone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the candle
      with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb show, that
      he had better not be funny just then. Having performed this friendly
      office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew&rsquo;s face, and awaited his directions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his
      face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and
      feared to know the worst. At length he raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to leave
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; &lsquo;bring him down. Hush!
      Quiet, Charley! Gently, Tom! Scarce, scarce!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was
      softly and immediately obeyed. There was no sound of their whereabout,
      when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand, and
      followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a hurried
      glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had concealed the
      lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard, unwashed, and
      unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How are you, Faguey?&rsquo; said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. &lsquo;Pop that
      shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it when
      I cut; that&rsquo;s the time of day! You&rsquo;ll be a fine young cracksman afore the
      old file now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round his
      middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See there, Faguey,&rsquo; he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots;
      &lsquo;not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of
      blacking, by Jove! But don&rsquo;t look at me in that way, man. All in good
      time. I can&rsquo;t talk about business till I&rsquo;ve eat and drank; so produce the
      sustainance, and let&rsquo;s have a quiet fill-out for the first time these
      three days!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon the
      table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the
      conversation. At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently watching
      his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue to the
      intelligence he brought; but in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon
      his features that they always wore: and through dirt, and beard, and
      whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of flash
      Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched every
      morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room, meanwhile, in
      irrepressible excitement. It was all of no use. Toby continued to eat with
      the utmost outward indifference, until he could eat no more; then,
      ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a glass of spirits and
      water, and composed himself for talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First and foremost, Faguey,&rsquo; said Toby.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes!&rsquo; interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to declare
      that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the low
      mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his eye, he
      quietly resumed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;First and foremost, Faguey,&rsquo; said the housebreaker, &lsquo;how&rsquo;s Bill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say&mdash;&rsquo; began Toby, turning pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mean!&rsquo; cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. &lsquo;Where are they?
      Sikes and the boy! Where are they? Where have they been? Where are they
      hiding? Why have they not been here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The crack failed,&rsquo; said Toby faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it,&rsquo; replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and
      pointing to it. &lsquo;What more?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They fired and hit the boy. We cut over the fields at the back, with him
      between us&mdash;straight as the crow flies&mdash;through hedge and ditch.
      They gave chase. Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind. We stopped to take
      him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were close upon
      our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows! We parted
      company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch. Alive or dead, that&rsquo;s
      all I know about him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining his
      hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVI &mdash; IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE
      SCENE; AND MANY THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND
      PERFORMED
    </h2>
    <p>
      The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover the
      effect of Toby Crackit&rsquo;s intelligence. He had relaxed nothing of his
      unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and
      disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a
      boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger: drove him
      back upon the pavement. Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the main
      streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at length
      emerged on Snow Hill. Here he walked even faster than before; nor did he
      linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if conscious that
      he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual shuffling pace,
      and seemed to breathe more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon the
      right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley, leading
      to Saffron Hill. In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge bunches of
      second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns; for here reside
      the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets. Hundreds of these
      handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the windows or flaunting
      from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are piled with them.
      Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its barber, its
      coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse. It is a
      commercial colony of itself: the emporium of petty larceny: visited at
      early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants, who traffic in
      dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they come. Here, the
      clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant, display their goods, as
      sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of old iron and bones, and
      heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and linen, rust and rot in the
      grimy cellars.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was into this place that the Jew turned. He was well known to the
      sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out to
      buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to their
      salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition until he
      reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to address a
      salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his person into a
      child&rsquo;s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a pipe at his
      warehouse door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!&rsquo; said this
      respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew&rsquo;s inquiry after his
      health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,&rsquo; said Fagin, elevating
      his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I&rsquo;ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,&rsquo; replied the
      trader; &lsquo;but it soon cools down again; don&rsquo;t you find it so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin nodded in the affirmative. Pointing in the direction of Saffron
      Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At the Cripples?&rsquo; inquired the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see,&rsquo; pursued the merchant, reflecting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, there&rsquo;s some half-dozen of &lsquo;em gone in, that I knows. I don&rsquo;t think
      your friend&rsquo;s there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sikes is not, I suppose?&rsquo; inquired the Jew, with a disappointed
      countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Non istwentus</i>, as the lawyers say,&rsquo; replied the little man,
      shaking his head, and looking amazingly sly. &lsquo;Have you got anything in my
      line to-night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing to-night,&rsquo; said the Jew, turning away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?&rsquo; cried the little man, calling
      after him. &lsquo;Stop! I don&rsquo;t mind if I have a drop there with you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he preferred
      being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very easily
      disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was, for a
      time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively&rsquo;s presence. By the time he had
      got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively, after
      ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight of him,
      again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a shake of the
      head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and mistrust were
      plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which
      the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons: was the
      public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured. Merely
      making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight upstairs, and
      opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating himself into the
      chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with his hand, as if in
      search of some particular person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was
      prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded red,
      from being visible outside. The ceiling was blackened, to prevent its
      colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the place was
      so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely possible to
      discern anything more. By degrees, however, as some of it cleared away
      through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused as the noises
      that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye grew more
      accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware of the
      presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a long
      table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of office
      in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose, and his
      face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a jingling piano
      in a remote corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over the
      keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a song;
      which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the company
      with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the accompanyist
      played the melody all through, as loud as he could. When this was over,
      the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the professional gentleman on
      the chairman&rsquo;s right and left volunteered a duet, and sang it, with great
      applause.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from
      among the group. There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the
      house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were
      proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give
      himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and an
      ear for everything that was said&mdash;and sharp ones, too. Near him were
      the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the compliments of
      the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a dozen proffered
      glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more boisterous admirers;
      whose countenances, expressive of almost every vice in almost every grade,
      irresistibly attracted the attention, by their very repulsiveness.
      Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its stages, were there, in their
      strongest aspect; and women: some with the last lingering tinge of their
      early freshness almost fading as you looked: others with every mark and
      stamp of their sex utterly beaten out, and presenting but one loathsome
      blank of profligacy and crime; some mere girls, others but young women,
      and none past the prime of life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of
      this dreary picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face
      while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without meeting
      that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in catching the eye
      of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him slightly, and left
      the room, as quietly as he had entered it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?&rsquo; inquired the man, as he followed him
      out to the landing. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you join us? They&rsquo;ll be delighted, every one of
      &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, &lsquo;Is <i>he</i>
      here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And no news of Barney?&rsquo; inquired Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None,&rsquo; replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t
      stir till it&rsquo;s all safe. Depend on it, they&rsquo;re on the scent down there;
      and that if he moved, he&rsquo;d blow upon the thing at once. He&rsquo;s all right
      enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him. I&rsquo;ll pound it, that
      Barney&rsquo;s managing properly. Let him alone for that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will <i>he</i> be here to-night?&rsquo; asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis
      on the pronoun as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monks, do you mean?&rsquo; inquired the landlord, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said the Jew. &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certain,&rsquo; replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; &lsquo;I expected
      him here before now. If you&rsquo;ll wait ten minutes, he&rsquo;ll be&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might be
      to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his
      absence. &lsquo;Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me
      to-night. No, say to-morrow. As he is not here, to-morrow will be time
      enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; said the man. &lsquo;Nothing more?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a word now,&rsquo; said the Jew, descending the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a hoarse
      whisper; &lsquo;what a time this would be for a sell! I&rsquo;ve got Phil Barker here:
      so drunk, that a boy might take him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! But it&rsquo;s not Phil Barker&rsquo;s time,&rsquo; said the Jew, looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him; so
      go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry lives&mdash;<i>while
      they last</i>. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The landlord reciprocated the old man&rsquo;s laugh; and returned to his guests.
      The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its former
      expression of anxiety and thought. After a brief reflection, he called a
      hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green. He dismissed
      him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s residence, and performed
      the short remainder of the distance, on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, &lsquo;if there is any deep
      play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was in her room, the woman said. Fagin crept softly upstairs, and
      entered it without any previous ceremony. The girl was alone; lying with
      her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has been drinking,&rsquo; thought the Jew, cooly, &lsquo;or perhaps she is only
      miserable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the
      noise thus occasioned, roused the girl. She eyed his crafty face narrowly,
      as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit&rsquo;s story. When it was
      concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a word. She
      pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she feverishly
      changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but this was all.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to
      assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly
      returned. Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice or
      thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the girl
      heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone. At length he made
      another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his most
      conciliatory tone, &lsquo;And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not tell;
      and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the boy, too,&rsquo; said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse of
      her face. &lsquo;Poor leetle child! Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The child,&rsquo; said the girl, suddenly looking up, &lsquo;is better where he is,
      than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies dead
      in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried the Jew, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, I do,&rsquo; returned the girl, meeting his gaze. &lsquo;I shall be glad to have
      him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over. I can&rsquo;t bear to
      have him about me. The sight of him turns me against myself, and all of
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pooh!&rsquo; said the Jew, scornfully. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re drunk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Am I?&rsquo; cried the girl bitterly. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no fault of yours, if I am not!
      You&rsquo;d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except now;&mdash;the
      humour doesn&rsquo;t suit you, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; rejoined the Jew, furiously. &lsquo;It does not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Change it, then!&rsquo; responded the girl, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Change it!&rsquo; exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his
      companion&rsquo;s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, &lsquo;I <i>will</i>
      change it! Listen to me, you drab. Listen to me, who with six words, can
      strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull&rsquo;s throat between my fingers
      now. If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind him; if he gets off free,
      and dead or alive, fails to restore him to me; murder him yourself if you
      would have him escape Jack Ketch. And do it the moment he sets foot in
      this room, or mind me, it will be too late!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is all this?&rsquo; cried the girl involuntarily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it?&rsquo; pursued Fagin, mad with rage. &lsquo;When the boy&rsquo;s worth hundreds
      of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way of getting
      safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could whistle away the
      lives of! And me bound, too, to a born devil that only wants the will, and
      has the power to, to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that instant
      checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole demeanour. A
      moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air; his eyes had
      dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now, he shrunk into a
      chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the apprehension of having
      himself disclosed some hidden villainy. After a short silence, he ventured
      to look round at his companion. He appeared somewhat reassured, on
      beholding her in the same listless attitude from which he had first roused
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nancy, dear!&rsquo; croaked the Jew, in his usual voice. &lsquo;Did you mind me,
      dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t worry me now, Fagin!&rsquo; replied the girl, raising her head languidly.
      &lsquo;If Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has done many a
      good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and when he can&rsquo;t he
      won&rsquo;t; so no more about that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Regarding this boy, my dear?&rsquo; said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his
      hands nervously together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy must take his chance with the rest,&rsquo; interrupted Nancy, hastily;
      &lsquo;and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm&rsquo;s way, and out of
      yours,&mdash;that is, if Bill comes to no harm. And if Toby got clear off,
      Bill&rsquo;s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill&rsquo;s worth two of Toby any time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And about what I was saying, my dear?&rsquo; observed the Jew, keeping his
      glistening eye steadily upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your must say it all over again, if it&rsquo;s anything you want me to do,&rsquo; 
      rejoined Nancy; &lsquo;and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow. You put
      me up for a minute; but now I&rsquo;m stupid again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of ascertaining
      whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but, she answered
      them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his searching looks,
      that his original impression of her being more than a trifle in liquor,
      was confirmed. Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a failing which was very
      common among the Jew&rsquo;s female pupils; and in which, in their tenderer
      years, they were rather encouraged than checked. Her disordered
      appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva which pervaded the
      apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of the justice of the
      Jew&rsquo;s supposition; and when, after indulging in the temporary display of
      violence above described, she subsided, first into dullness, and
      afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the influence of which she
      shed tears one minute, and in the next gave utterance to various
      exclamations of &lsquo;Never say die!&rsquo; and divers calculations as to what might
      be the amount of the odds so long as a lady or gentleman was happy, Mr.
      Fagin, who had had considerable experience of such matters in his time,
      saw, with great satisfaction, that she was very far gone indeed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his
      twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard,
      and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned, Mr.
      Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend asleep,
      with her head upon the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was within an hour of midnight. The weather being dark, and piercing
      cold, he had no great temptation to loiter. The sharp wind that scoured
      the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as of dust and
      mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all appearance hastening
      fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the Jew, however, and
      straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering, as every fresh gust
      drove him rudely on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling in
      his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a projecting
      entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road, glided up to
      him unperceived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fagin!&rsquo; whispered a voice close to his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the Jew, turning quickly round, &lsquo;is that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes!&rsquo; interrupted the stranger. &lsquo;I have been lingering here these two
      hours. Where the devil have you been?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;On your business, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his
      companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke. &lsquo;On your business all
      night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, of course!&rsquo; said the stranger, with a sneer. &lsquo;Well; and what&rsquo;s come
      of it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing good,&rsquo; said the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing bad, I hope?&rsquo; said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a
      startled look on his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger,
      interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this
      time arrived: remarking, that he had better say what he had got to say,
      under cover: for his blood was chilled with standing about so long, and
      the wind blew through him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking
      home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered something
      about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request in a
      peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to close it
      softly, while he got a light.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s as dark as the grave,&rsquo; said the man, groping forward a few steps.
      &lsquo;Make haste!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shut the door,&rsquo; whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he spoke,
      it closed with a loud noise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That wasn&rsquo;t my doing,&rsquo; said the other man, feeling his way. &lsquo;The wind
      blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp
      with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in this
      confounded hole.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs. After a short absence, he
      returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby Crackit was
      asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in the front one.
      Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We can say the few words we&rsquo;ve got to say in here, my dear,&rsquo; said the
      Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; &lsquo;and as there are holes in
      the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we&rsquo;ll set the
      candle on the stairs. There!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper
      flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door. This done, he led the
      way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a broken
      arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which stood behind
      the door. Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat himself with the
      air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the arm-chair opposite, they
      sat face to face. It was not quite dark; the door was partially open; and
      the candle outside, threw a feeble reflection on the opposite wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      They conversed for some time in whispers. Though nothing of the
      conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and
      there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be
      defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the
      latter was in a state of considerable irritation. They might have been
      talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks&mdash;by which
      name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course of
      their colloquy&mdash;said, raising his voice a little, &lsquo;I tell you again,
      it was badly planned. Why not have kept him here among the rest, and made
      a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at once?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only hear him!&rsquo; exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, do you mean to say you couldn&rsquo;t have done it, if you had chosen?&rsquo; 
      demanded Monks, sternly. &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t you done it, with other boys, scores of
      times? If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn&rsquo;t you
      have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps for
      life?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whose turn would that have served, my dear?&rsquo; inquired the Jew humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mine,&rsquo; replied Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not mine,&rsquo; said the Jew, submissively. &lsquo;He might have become of use
      to me. When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only reasonable that
      the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my good friend?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What then?&rsquo; demanded Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,&rsquo; replied the Jew; &lsquo;he
      was not like other boys in the same circumstances.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curse him, no!&rsquo; muttered the man, &lsquo;or he would have been a thief, long
      ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had no hold upon him to make him worse,&rsquo; pursued the Jew, anxiously
      watching the countenance of his companion. &lsquo;His hand was not in. I had
      nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the beginning,
      or we labour in vain. What could I do? Send him out with the Dodger and
      Charley? We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I trembled for us all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>That</i> was not my doing,&rsquo; observed Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, my dear!&rsquo; renewed the Jew. &lsquo;And I don&rsquo;t quarrel with it now;
      because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on
      the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you
      were looking for. Well! I got him back for you by means of the girl; and
      then <i>she</i> begins to favour him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Throttle the girl!&rsquo; said Monks, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, we can&rsquo;t afford to do that just now, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew,
      smiling; &lsquo;and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one of
      these days, I might be glad to have it done. I know what these girls are,
      Monks, well. As soon as the boy begins to harden, she&rsquo;ll care no more for
      him, than for a block of wood. You want him made a thief. If he is alive,
      I can make him one from this time; and, if&mdash;if&mdash;&rsquo; said the Jew,
      drawing nearer to the other,&mdash;&lsquo;it&rsquo;s not likely, mind,&mdash;but if
      the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no fault of mine if he is!&rsquo; interposed the other man, with a look of
      terror, and clasping the Jew&rsquo;s arm with trembling hands. &lsquo;Mind that.
      Fagin! I had no hand in it. Anything but his death, I told you from the
      first. I won&rsquo;t shed blood; it&rsquo;s always found out, and haunts a man
      besides. If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear me? Fire
      this infernal den! What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both arms,
      as he sprung to his feet. &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall. &lsquo;The shadow! I saw
      the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the wainscot like
      a breath!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room. The
      candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been placed. It
      showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white faces. They
      listened intently: a profound silence reigned throughout the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s your fancy,&rsquo; said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I saw it!&rsquo; replied Monks, trembling. &lsquo;It was bending forward
      when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and,
      telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs. They
      looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty. They descended
      into the passage, and thence into the cellars below. The green damp hung
      upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug glistened in the
      light of the candle; but all was still as death.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think now?&rsquo; said the Jew, when they had regained the passage.
      &lsquo;Besides ourselves, there&rsquo;s not a creature in the house except Toby and
      the boys; and they&rsquo;re safe enough. See here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket; and
      explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them in, to
      prevent any intrusion on the conference.
    </p>
    <p>
      This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His
      protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they
      proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he gave
      vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have been
      his excited imagination. He declined any renewal of the conversation,
      however, for that night: suddenly remembering that it was past one
      o&rsquo;clock. And so the amiable couple parted.

      CHAPTER XXVII &mdash; ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER;
      WHICH DESERTED A LADY, MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY
    </h2>
    <p>
      As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so mighty a
      personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and the skirts
      of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as it might suit
      his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less become his
      station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a lady on whom
      that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and affection, and in
      whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming from such a quarter,
      might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of whatsoever degree; the
      historian whose pen traces these words&mdash;trusting that he knows his
      place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence for those upon earth to
      whom high and important authority is delegated&mdash;hastens to pay them
      that respect which their position demands, and to treat them with all that
      duteous ceremony which their exalted rank, and (by consequence) great
      virtues, imperatively claim at his hands. Towards this end, indeed, he had
      purposed to introduce, in this place, a dissertation touching the divine
      right of beadles, and elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no
      wrong: which could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable
      to the right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by
      want of time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting
      opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that a
      beadle properly constituted: that is to say, a parochial beadle, attached
      to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official capacity the
      parochial church: is, in right and virtue of his office, possessed of all
      the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and that to none of those
      excellences, can mere companies&rsquo; beadles, or court-of-law beadles, or even
      chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last, and they in a very lowly and
      inferior degree), lay the remotest sustainable claim.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs, made
      a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety the exact
      condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats of the
      chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times; before he
      began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return. Thinking begets
      thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s approach, it occured to
      Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and virtuous way of spending the
      time, if he were further to allay his curiousity by a cursory glance at
      the interior of Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s chest of drawers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was
      approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded to
      make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers:
      which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture,
      carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with
      dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction. Arriving, in
      course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the key),
      and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken, gave
      forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble returned
      with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old attitude,
      said, with a grave and determined air, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll do it!&rsquo; He followed up this
      remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a waggish manner for ten
      minutes, as though he were remonstrating with himself for being such a
      pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his legs in profile, with much
      seeming pleasure and interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney,
      hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a chair
      by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the other
      over her heart, and gasped for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Corney,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, &lsquo;what is this,
      ma&rsquo;am? Has anything happened, ma&rsquo;am? Pray answer me: I&rsquo;m on&mdash;on&mdash;&rsquo; 
      Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the word
      &lsquo;tenterhooks,&rsquo; so he said &lsquo;broken bottles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Mr. Bumble!&rsquo; cried the lady, &lsquo;I have been so dreadfully put out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put out, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble; &lsquo;who has dared to&mdash;? I know!&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, &lsquo;this is them
      wicious paupers!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s dreadful to think of!&rsquo; said the lady, shuddering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then <i>don&rsquo;t</i> think of it, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; whimpered the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then take something, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble soothingly. &lsquo;A little of the
      wine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for the world!&rsquo; replied Mrs. Corney. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t,&mdash;oh! The top
      shelf in the right-hand corner&mdash;oh!&rsquo; Uttering these words, the good
      lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion
      from internal spasms. Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching a
      pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated, filled
      a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady&rsquo;s lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m better now,&rsquo; said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half of
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,
      bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Peppermint,&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently on
      the beadle as she spoke. &lsquo;Try it! There&rsquo;s a little&mdash;a little
      something else in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips;
      took another taste; and put the cup down empty.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very comforting,&rsquo; said Mrs. Corney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much so indeed, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the beadle. As he spoke, he drew a
      chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to
      distress her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Corney. &lsquo;I am a foolish, excitable, weak creetur.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not weak, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little closer.
      &lsquo;Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are all weak creeturs,&rsquo; said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general
      principle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So we are,&rsquo; said the beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the
      expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by
      removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s chair, where it had
      previously rested, to Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s apron-string, round which it gradually
      became entwined.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are all weak creeturs,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Corney sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t sigh, Mrs. Corney,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; said Mrs. Corney. And she sighed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a very comfortable room, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble looking round.
      &lsquo;Another room, and this, ma&rsquo;am, would be a complete thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It would be too much for one,&rsquo; murmured the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not for two, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. &lsquo;Eh, Mrs.
      Corney?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle
      drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney&rsquo;s face. Mrs. Corney, with great
      propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at her
      pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The board allows you coals, don&rsquo;t they, Mrs. Corney?&rsquo; inquired the
      beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And candles,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coals, candles, and house-rent free,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;Oh, Mrs. Corney,
      what an Angel you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling. She sank into Mr.
      Bumble&rsquo;s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a passionate
      kiss upon her chaste nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such porochial perfection!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. &lsquo;You know
      that Mr. Stout is worse to-night, my fascinator?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t live a week, the doctor says,&rsquo; pursued Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;He is the
      master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that wacancy
      must be filled up. Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this opens! What a
      opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Corney sobbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The little word?&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty. &lsquo;The
      one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ye&mdash;ye&mdash;yes!&rsquo; sighed out the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One more,&rsquo; pursued the beadle; &lsquo;compose your darling feelings for only
      one more. When is it to come off?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak: and twice failed. At length summoning
      up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s neck, and said, it
      might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was &lsquo;a irresistible
      duck.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract was
      solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture; which
      was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of the
      lady&rsquo;s spirits. While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr. Bumble
      with the old woman&rsquo;s decease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll call at
      Sowerberry&rsquo;s as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning. Was it
      that as frightened you, love?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t anything particular, dear,&rsquo; said the lady evasively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must have been something, love,&rsquo; urged Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;Won&rsquo;t you tell
      your own B.?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not now,&rsquo; rejoined the lady; &lsquo;one of these days. After we&rsquo;re married,
      dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After we&rsquo;re married!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;It wasn&rsquo;t any impudence from
      any of them male paupers as&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, love!&rsquo; interposed the lady, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I thought it was,&rsquo; continued Mr. Bumble; &lsquo;if I thought as any one of
      &lsquo;em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They wouldn&rsquo;t have dared to do it, love,&rsquo; responded the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They had better not!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. &lsquo;Let me see
      any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I
      can tell him that he wouldn&rsquo;t do it a second time!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed no
      very high compliment to the lady&rsquo;s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble accompanied
      the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched with this
      proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration, that he was
      indeed a dove.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat; and,
      having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future partner,
      once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing, for a few
      minutes, in the male paupers&rsquo; ward, to abuse them a little, with the view
      of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of workhouse-master
      with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications, Mr. Bumble left the
      building with a light heart, and bright visions of his future promotion:
      which served to occupy his mind until he reached the shop of the
      undertaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and Noah
      Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a greater
      amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient performance
      of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was not closed,
      although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up. Mr. Bumble tapped with
      his cane on the counter several times; but, attracting no attention, and
      beholding a light shining through the glass-window of the little parlour
      at the back of the shop, he made bold to peep in and see what was going
      forward; and when he saw what was going forward, he was not a little
      surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and
      butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the upper
      end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an easy-chair,
      with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open clasp-knife in one
      hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other. Close beside him stood
      Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which Mr. Claypole condescended
      to swallow, with remarkable avidity. A more than ordinary redness in the
      region of the young gentleman&rsquo;s nose, and a kind of fixed wink in his
      right eye, denoted that he was in a slight degree intoxicated; these
      symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish with which he took his
      oysters, for which nothing but a strong appreciation of their cooling
      properties, in cases of internal fever, could have sufficiently accounted.
    </p>

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0137.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!&rsquo; said Charlotte; &lsquo;try him, do;
      only this one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a delicious thing is a oyster!&rsquo; remarked Mr. Claypole, after he had
      swallowed it. &lsquo;What a pity it is, a number of &lsquo;em should ever make you
      feel uncomfortable; isn&rsquo;t it, Charlotte?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s quite a cruelty,&rsquo; said Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So it is,&rsquo; acquiesced Mr. Claypole. &lsquo;An&rsquo;t yer fond of oysters?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not overmuch,&rsquo; replied Charlotte. &lsquo;I like to see you eat &lsquo;em, Noah dear,
      better than eating &lsquo;em myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor!&rsquo; said Noah, reflectively; &lsquo;how queer!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have another,&rsquo; said Charlotte. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s one with such a beautiful,
      delicate beard!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t manage any more,&rsquo; said Noah. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry. Come here,
      Charlotte, and I&rsquo;ll kiss yer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room. &lsquo;Say that again, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron. Mr. Claypole,
      without making any further change in his position than suffering his legs
      to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;How dare you
      mention such a thing, sir? And how dare you encourage him, you insolent
      minx? Kiss her!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation. &lsquo;Faugh!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean to do it!&rsquo; said Noah, blubbering. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s always a-kissing
      of me, whether I like it, or not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Noah,&rsquo; cried Charlotte, reproachfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yer are; yer know yer are!&rsquo; retorted Noah. &lsquo;She&rsquo;s always a-doin&rsquo; of it,
      Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and makes all
      manner of love!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; cried Mr. Bumble, sternly. &lsquo;Take yourself downstairs, ma&rsquo;am.
      Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master comes home,
      at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that Mr. Bumble said
      he was to send a old woman&rsquo;s shell after breakfast to-morrow morning. Do
      you hear sir? Kissing!&rsquo; cried Mr. Bumble, holding up his hands. &lsquo;The sin
      and wickedness of the lower orders in this porochial district is
      frightful! If Parliament don&rsquo;t take their abominable courses under
      consideration, this country&rsquo;s ruined, and the character of the peasantry
      gone for ever!&rsquo; With these words, the beadle strode, with a lofty and
      gloomy air, from the undertaker&rsquo;s premises.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have
      made all necessary preparations for the old woman&rsquo;s funeral, let us set on
      foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether he be
      still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXVIII &mdash; LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS
      ADVENTURES
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;Wolves tear your throats!&rsquo; muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth. &lsquo;I wish I
      was among some of you; you&rsquo;d howl the hoarser for it.&rsquo; 
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate ferocity
      that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body of the
      wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an instant,
      to look back at his pursuers.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud
      shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the
      neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in
      every direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop, you white-livered hound!&rsquo; cried the robber, shouting after Toby
      Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead.
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. For he was
      not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot; and Sikes
      was in no mood to be played with.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bear a hand with the boy,&rsquo; cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his
      confederate. &lsquo;Come back!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for
      want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly
      along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quicker!&rsquo; cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and
      drawing a pistol from his pocket. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t play booty with me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the noise grew louder. Sikes, again looking round, could
      discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing the gate of
      the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were some paces in
      advance of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all up, Bill!&rsquo; cried Toby; &lsquo;drop the kid, and show &lsquo;em your heels.&rsquo; 
      With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance of being shot
      by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his enemies, fairly
      turned tail, and darted off at full speed. Sikes clenched his teeth; took
      one look around; threw over the prostrate form of Oliver, the cape in
      which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along the front of the hedge, as
      if to distract the attention of those behind, from the spot where the boy
      lay; paused, for a second, before another hedge which met it at right
      angles; and whirling his pistol high into the air, cleared it at a bound,
      and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ho, ho, there!&rsquo; cried a tremulous voice in the rear. &lsquo;Pincher! Neptune!
      Come here, come here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no particular
      relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily answered to the
      command. Three men, who had by this time advanced some distance into the
      field, stopped to take counsel together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my <i>orders</i>, is,&rsquo; said the
      fattest man of the party, &lsquo;that we &lsquo;mediately go home again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,&rsquo; said a
      shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very pale
      in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,&rsquo; said the third, who
      had called the dogs back, &lsquo;Mr. Giles ought to know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied the shorter man; &lsquo;and whatever Mr. Giles says, it
      isn&rsquo;t our place to contradict him. No, no, I know my sitiwation! Thank my
      stars, I know my sitiwation.&rsquo; To tell the truth, the little man <i>did</i>
      seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that it was by no
      means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are afraid, Brittles,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I an&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Brittles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are,&rsquo; said Giles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,&rsquo; said Brittles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a lie, Brittles,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles&rsquo;s taunt; and Mr. Giles&rsquo;s
      taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of
      going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment. The
      third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;we&rsquo;re all afraid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak for yourself, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the
      party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I do,&rsquo; replied the man. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s natural and proper to be afraid, under
      such circumstances. I am.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; said Brittles; &lsquo;only there&rsquo;s no call to tell a man he is, so
      bounceably.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that <i>he</i>
      was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again
      with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest wind
      of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely insisted
      on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it&rsquo;s wonderful,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, &lsquo;what a man
      will do, when his blood is up. I should have committed murder&mdash;I know
      I should&mdash;if we&rsquo;d caught one of them rascals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as their
      blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued upon the
      cause of this sudden change in their temperament.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know what it was,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles; &lsquo;it was the gate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder if it was,&rsquo; exclaimed Brittles, catching at the idea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may depend upon it,&rsquo; said Giles, &lsquo;that that gate stopped the flow of
      the excitement. I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was climbing
      over it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the same
      unpleasant sensation at that precise moment. It was quite obvious,
      therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no doubt
      regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because all three
      remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the instant of
      its occurance.
    </p>
    <p>
      This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the burglars,
      and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse, and who had
      been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in the pursuit.
      Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and steward to the old
      lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work: who, having entered
      her service a mere child, was treated as a promising young boy still,
      though he was something past thirty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very close
      together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round, whenever a
      fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried back to a
      tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its light should
      inform the thieves in what direction to fire. Catching up the light, they
      made the best of their way home, at a good round trot; and long after
      their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the light might have been
      seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like some exhalation of the
      damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was swiftly borne.
    </p>
    <p>
      The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along the
      ground like a dense cloud of smoke. The grass was wet; the pathways, and
      low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of an unwholesome
      wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning. Still, Oliver lay
      motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning drew on apace. The air become more sharp and piercing, as its
      first dull hue&mdash;the death of night, rather than the birth of day&mdash;glimmered
      faintly in the sky. The objects which had looked dim and terrible in the
      darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually resolved into their
      familiar shapes. The rain came down, thick and fast, and pattered noisily
      among the leafless bushes. But, Oliver felt it not, as it beat against
      him; for he still lay stretched, helpless and unconscious, on his bed of
      clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and
      uttering it, the boy awoke. His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl, hung
      heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with blood. He
      was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a sitting posture;
      when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help, and groaned with
      pain. Trembling in every joint, from cold and exhaustion, he made an
      effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from head to foot, fell prostrate
      on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long plunged,
      Oliver: urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which seemed to warn
      him that if he lay there, he must surely die: got upon his feet, and
      essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to and fro like a
      drunken man. But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with his head drooping
      languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he knew not whither.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his
      mind. He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who were
      angrily disputing&mdash;for the very words they said, sounded in his ears;
      and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some violent
      effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was talking to them.
      Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the previous day; and as
      shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber&rsquo;s grasp upon his wrist.
      Suddenly, he started back at the report of firearms; there rose into the
      air, loud cries and shouts; lights gleamed before his eyes; all was noise
      and tumult, as some unseen hand bore him hurriedly away. Through all these
      rapid visions, there ran an undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which
      wearied and tormented him incessantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars of
      gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he reached a
      road. Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house,
      which perhaps he could reach. Pitying his condition, they might have
      compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought, to
      die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields. He summoned up all
      his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps towards it.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had seen
      it before. He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape and aspect
      of the building seemed familiar to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      That garden wall! On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last
      night, and prayed the two men&rsquo;s mercy. It was the very house they had
      attempted to rob.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that,
      for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of
      flight. Flight! He could scarcely stand: and if he were in full possession
      of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame, whither could he
      fly? He pushed against the garden-gate; it was unlocked, and swung open on
      its hinges. He tottered across the lawn; climbed the steps; knocked
      faintly at the door; and, his whole strength failing him, sunk down
      against one of the pillars of the little portico.
    </p>
    <p>
      It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker,
      were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the night,
      with tea and sundries, in the kitchen. Not that it was Mr. Giles&rsquo;s habit
      to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants: towards whom it
      was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty affability, which,
      while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of his superior position
      in society. But, death, fires, and burglary, make all men equals; so Mr.
      Giles sat with his legs stretched out before the kitchen fender, leaning
      his left arm on the table, while, with his right, he illustrated a
      circumstantial and minute account of the robbery, to which his bearers
      (but especially the cook and housemaid, who were of the party) listened
      with breathless interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was about half-past two,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles, &lsquo;or I wouldn&rsquo;t swear that it
      mightn&rsquo;t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and, turning
      round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned round in his
      chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him to imitate
      bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the
      housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker, who
      pretended not to hear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Heerd a noise,&rsquo; continued Mr. Giles. &lsquo;I says, at first, &ldquo;This is
      illusion&rdquo;; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the noise
      again, distinct.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What sort of a noise?&rsquo; asked the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A kind of a busting noise,&rsquo; replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,&rsquo; 
      suggested Brittles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was, when <i>you</i> heerd it, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Giles; &lsquo;but, at this
      time, it had a busting sound. I turned down the clothes&rsquo;; continued Giles,
      rolling back the table-cloth, &lsquo;sat up in bed; and listened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated &lsquo;Lor!&rsquo; and drew their
      chairs closer together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heerd it now, quite apparent,&rsquo; resumed Mr. Giles. &lsquo;&ldquo;Somebody,&rdquo; I says,
      &ldquo;is forcing of a door, or window; what&rsquo;s to be done? I&rsquo;ll call up that
      poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed; or his
      throat,&rdquo; I says, &ldquo;may be cut from his right ear to his left, without his
      ever knowing it.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the speaker,
      and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face expressive of
      the most unmitigated horror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tossed off the clothes,&rsquo; said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth, and
      looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, &lsquo;got softly out of bed; drew
      on a pair of&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ladies present, Mr. Giles,&rsquo; murmured the tinker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Of <i>shoes</i>, sir,&rsquo; said Giles, turning upon him, and laying
      great emphasis on the word; &lsquo;seized the loaded pistol that always goes
      upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.
      &ldquo;Brittles,&rdquo; I says, when I had woke him, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be frightened!&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you did,&rsquo; observed Brittles, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re dead men, I think, Brittles,&rdquo; I says,&rsquo; continued Giles; &lsquo;&ldquo;but
      don&rsquo;t be frightened.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Was</i> he frightened?&rsquo; asked the cook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; replied Mr. Giles. &lsquo;He was as firm&mdash;ah! pretty
      near as firm as I was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have died at once, I&rsquo;m sure, if it had been me,&rsquo; observed the
      housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a woman,&rsquo; retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brittles is right,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly; &lsquo;from
      a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a dark
      lantern that was standing on Brittle&rsquo;s hob, and groped our way downstairs
      in the pitch dark,&mdash;as it might be so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes shut,
      to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he started
      violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried back to his
      chair. The cook and housemaid screamed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a knock,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. &lsquo;Open the
      door, somebody.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nobody moved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in the
      morning,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded him,
      and looking very blank himself; &lsquo;but the door must be opened. Do you hear,
      somebody?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being
      naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that the
      inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he tendered
      no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the tinker; but he had
      suddenly fallen asleep. The women were out of the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,&rsquo; 
      said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, &lsquo;I am ready to make one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So am I,&rsquo; said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen
      asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat
      re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that it
      was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front. The
      two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear. By the
      advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any evil-disposed
      person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by a master-stoke of
      policy, originating in the brain of the same ingenious gentleman, the
      dogs&rsquo; tails were well pinched, in the hall, to make them bark savagely.
    </p>
    <p>
      These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the
      tinker&rsquo;s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and
      gave the word of command to open the door. Brittles obeyed; the group,
      peeping timorously over each other&rsquo;s shoulders, beheld no more formidable
      object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and exhausted, who raised
      his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their compassion.

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0143.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A boy!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the
      background. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the&mdash;eh?&mdash;Why&mdash;Brittles&mdash;look
      here&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver,
      than he uttered a loud cry. Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and one
      arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the hall,
      and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here he is!&rsquo; bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up the
      staircase; &lsquo;here&rsquo;s one of the thieves, ma&rsquo;am! Here&rsquo;s a thief, miss!
      Wounded, miss! I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;In a lantern, miss,&rsquo; cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side
      of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.
      Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in endeavouring
      to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be hanged. In the
      midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard a sweet female
      voice, which quelled it in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Giles!&rsquo; whispered the voice from the stair-head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m here, miss,&rsquo; replied Mr. Giles. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened, miss; I ain&rsquo;t
      much injured. He didn&rsquo;t make a very desperate resistance, miss! I was soon
      too many for him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; replied the young lady; &lsquo;you frighten my aunt as much as the
      thieves did. Is the poor creature much hurt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wounded desperate, miss,&rsquo; replied Giles, with indescribable complacency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He looks as if he was a-going, miss,&rsquo; bawled Brittles, in the same manner
      as before. &lsquo;Wouldn&rsquo;t you like to come and look at him, miss, in case he
      should?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, pray; there&rsquo;s a good man!&rsquo; rejoined the lady. &lsquo;Wait quietly only
      one instant, while I speak to aunt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped away.
      She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person was to be
      carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles&rsquo;s room; and that Brittles was to
      saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to Chertsey: from which
      place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a constable and doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But won&rsquo;t you take one look at him, first, miss?&rsquo; asked Mr. Giles, with
      as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he had
      skilfully brought down. &lsquo;Not one little peep, miss?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not now, for the world,&rsquo; replied the young lady. &lsquo;Poor fellow! Oh! treat
      him kindly, Giles for my sake!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a
      glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child. Then,
      bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and
      solicitude of a woman.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXIX &mdash; HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE
      HOUSE, TO WHICH OLIVER RESORTED
    </h2>
    <p>
      In a handsome room: though its furniture had rather the air of
      old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance: there sat two ladies at a
      well-spread breakfast-table. Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous care in a
      full suit of black, was in attendance upon them. He had taken his station
      some half-way between the side-board and the breakfast-table; and, with
      his body drawn up to its full height, his head thrown back, and inclined
      the merest trifle on one side, his left leg advanced, and his right hand
      thrust into his waist-coat, while his left hung down by his side, grasping
      a waiter, looked like one who laboured under a very agreeable sense of his
      own merits and importance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed
      oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she. Dressed with
      the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone costume,
      with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which rather served
      to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its effect, she sat, in a
      stately manner, with her hands folded on the table before her. Her eyes
      (and age had dimmed but little of their brightness) were attentively upon
      her young companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood; at
      that age, when, if ever angels be for God&rsquo;s good purposes enthroned in
      mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in such as
      hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was not past seventeen. Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould; so
      mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her element,
      nor its rough creatures her fit companions. The very intelligence that
      shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her noble head, seemed
      scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the changing expression of
      sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights that played about the face,
      and left no shadow there; above all, the smile, the cheerful, happy smile,
      were made for Home, and fireside peace and happiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to
      raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put back
      her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into her
      beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless loveliness, that
      blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?&rsquo; asked the old
      lady, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An hour and twelve minutes, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Mr. Giles, referring to a
      silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is always slow,&rsquo; remarked the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brittles always was a slow boy, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied the attendant. And
      seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of
      thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a fast
      one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He gets worse instead of better, I think,&rsquo; said the elder lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other boys,&rsquo; 
      said the young lady, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a
      respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out of
      which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door: and
      who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process, burst into
      the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the breakfast-table
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard of such a thing!&rsquo; exclaimed the fat gentleman. &lsquo;My dear
      Mrs. Maylie&mdash;bless my soul&mdash;in the silence of the night, too&mdash;I
      <i>never</i> heard of such a thing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands with
      both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,&rsquo; said the fat
      gentleman. &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you send? Bless me, my man should have come in a
      minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted; or
      anybody, I&rsquo;m sure, under such circumstances. Dear, dear! So unexpected! In
      the silence of the night, too!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having
      been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the
      established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact
      business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two
      previous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you, Miss Rose,&rsquo; said the doctor, turning to the young lady, &lsquo;I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! very much so, indeed,&rsquo; said Rose, interrupting him; &lsquo;but there is a
      poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! to be sure,&rsquo; replied the doctor, &lsquo;so there is. That was your
      handiwork, Giles, I understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights, blushed
      very red, and said that he had had that honour.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Honour, eh?&rsquo; said the doctor; &lsquo;well, I don&rsquo;t know; perhaps it&rsquo;s as
      honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at twelve
      paces. Fancy that he fired in the air, and you&rsquo;ve fought a duel, Giles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust
      attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was not
      for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it was no
      joke to the opposite party.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gad, that&rsquo;s true!&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;Where is he? Show me the way. I&rsquo;ll
      look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie. That&rsquo;s the little window that
      he got in at, eh? Well, I couldn&rsquo;t have believed it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is going
      upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a surgeon in the
      neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles round as &lsquo;the doctor,&rsquo; 
      had grown fat, more from good-humour than from good living: and was as
      kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an old bachelor, as will be found
      in five times that space, by any explorer alive.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had
      anticipated. A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a bedroom
      bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down stairs
      perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that something
      important was going on above. At length he returned; and in reply to an
      anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious, and closed the
      door, carefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,&rsquo; said the doctor,
      standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is not in danger, I hope?&rsquo; said the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that would <i>not</i> be an extraordinary thing, under the
      circumstances,&rsquo; replied the doctor; &lsquo;though I don&rsquo;t think he is. Have you
      seen the thief?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; rejoined the old lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor heard anything about him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, ma&rsquo;am, interposed Mr. Giles; &lsquo;but I was going to tell
      you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his
      mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy. Such commendations had
      been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of him,
      help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes; during which
      he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief reputation for undaunted
      courage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rose wished to see the man,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &lsquo;but I wouldn&rsquo;t hear of
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; rejoined the doctor. &lsquo;There is nothing very alarming in his
      appearance. Have you any objection to see him in my presence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it be necessary,&rsquo; replied the old lady, &lsquo;certainly not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I think it is necessary,&rsquo; said the doctor; &lsquo;at all events, I am
      quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you
      postponed it. He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow me&mdash;Miss
      Rose, will you permit me? Not the slightest fear, I pledge you my honour!&rsquo; 
    </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXX &mdash; RELATES WHAT OLIVER&rsquo;S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM
    </h2>
    <p>
      With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised in
      the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady&rsquo;s arm through
      one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie, led them,
      with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of a
      bedroom-door, &lsquo;let us hear what you think of him. He has not been shaved
      very recently, but he don&rsquo;t look at all ferocious notwithstanding. Stop,
      though! Let me first see that he is in visiting order.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Stepping before them, he looked into the room. Motioning them to advance,
      he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back the
      curtains of the bed. Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged ruffian
      they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child: worn with pain and
      exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep. His wounded arm, bound and
      splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined upon the
      other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it streamed over the
      pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a
      minute or so, in silence. Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the
      younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the
      bedside, gathered Oliver&rsquo;s hair from his face. As she stooped over him,
      her tears fell upon his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity
      and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection he
      had never known. Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of water
      in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a familiar
      word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes that never
      were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some brief memory of
      a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have awakened; which no
      voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What can this mean?&rsquo; exclaimed the elder lady. &lsquo;This poor child can never
      have been the pupil of robbers!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Vice,&rsquo; said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, &lsquo;takes up her abode in
      many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But at so early an age!&rsquo; urged Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear young lady,&rsquo; rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his head;
      &lsquo;crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered alone. The
      youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, can you&mdash;oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has
      been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?&rsquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared it
      was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the patient, led
      the way into an adjoining apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But even if he has been wicked,&rsquo; pursued Rose, &lsquo;think how young he is;
      think that he may never have known a mother&rsquo;s love, or the comfort of a
      home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven him
      to herd with men who have forced him to guilt. Aunt, dear aunt, for
      mercy&rsquo;s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick child to a
      prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his chances of
      amendment. Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never felt the want of
      parents in your goodness and affection, but that I might have done so, and
      might have been equally helpless and unprotected with this poor child,
      have pity upon him before it is too late!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear love,&rsquo; said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to her
      bosom, &lsquo;do you think I would harm a hair of his head?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, no!&rsquo; replied Rose, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, surely,&rsquo; said the old lady; &lsquo;my days are drawing to their close: and
      may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to save
      him, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me think, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said the doctor; &lsquo;let me think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns up
      and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his toes, and
      frowning frightfully. After various exclamations of &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got it now&rsquo; and
      &lsquo;no, I haven&rsquo;t,&rsquo; and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at
      length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles,
      and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it. Giles is a faithful fellow
      and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a thousand
      ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides. You don&rsquo;t object
      to that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,&rsquo; replied Mrs.
      Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no other,&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;No other, take my word for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then my aunt invests you with full power,&rsquo; said Rose, smiling through her
      tears; &lsquo;but pray don&rsquo;t be harder upon the poor fellows than is
      indispensably necessary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You seem to think,&rsquo; retorted the doctor, &lsquo;that everybody is disposed to
      be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for the
      sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as
      vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow who
      appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that I might
      avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for doing so,
      as the present.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,&rsquo; returned Rose,
      blushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the doctor, laughing heartily, &lsquo;that is no very difficult
      matter. But to return to this boy. The great point of our agreement is yet
      to come. He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and although I have
      told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that he musn&rsquo;t be moved
      or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may converse with him
      without danger. Now I make this stipulation&mdash;that I shall examine him
      in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we judge, and I can
      show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he is a real and
      thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall be left to his
      fate, without any farther interference on my part, at all events.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, aunt!&rsquo; entreated Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, aunt!&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;Is is a bargain?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He cannot be hardened in vice,&rsquo; said Rose; &lsquo;It is impossible.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; retorted the doctor; &lsquo;then so much the more reason for
      acceding to my proposition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down to
      wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial than
      Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed on, and
      still Oliver slumbered heavily. It was evening, indeed, before the
      kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at length
      sufficiently restored to be spoken to. The boy was very ill, he said, and
      weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled with anxiety to
      disclose something, that he deemed it better to give him the opportunity,
      than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next morning: which he
      should otherwise have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conference was a long one. Oliver told them all his simple history,
      and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength. It was a
      solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice of the sick
      child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities which hard men
      had brought upon him. Oh! if when we oppress and grind our
      fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences of
      human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly it is
      true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their after-vengeance on our
      heads; if we heard but one instant, in imagination, the deep testimony of
      dead men&rsquo;s voices, which no power can stifle, and no pride shut out; where
      would be the injury and injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and
      wrong, that each day&rsquo;s life brings with it!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver&rsquo;s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness
      and virtue watched him as he slept. He felt calm and happy, and could have
      died without a murmur.
    </p>
    <p>
      The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to
      rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them
      for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr.
      Giles. And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that he
      could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the kitchen;
      so into the kitchen he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament, the
      women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had received a
      special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of the day, in
      consideration of his services), and the constable. The latter gentleman
      had a large staff, a large head, large features, and large half-boots; and
      he looked as if he had been taking a proportionate allowance of ale&mdash;as
      indeed he had.
    </p>
    <p>
      The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for Mr.
      Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor entered;
      Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating everything,
      before his superior said it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit still!&rsquo; said the doctor, waving his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles. &lsquo;Misses wished some ale to be given out,
      sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir, and was
      disposed for company, I am taking mine among &lsquo;em here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen generally
      were understood to express the gratification they derived from Mr. Giles&rsquo;s
      condescension. Mr. Giles looked round with a patronising air, as much as
      to say that so long as they behaved properly, he would never desert them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How is the patient to-night, sir?&rsquo; asked Giles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So-so&rsquo;; returned the doctor. &lsquo;I am afraid you have got yourself into a
      scrape there, Mr. Giles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you don&rsquo;t mean to say, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles, trembling, &lsquo;that he&rsquo;s
      going to die. If I thought it, I should never be happy again. I wouldn&rsquo;t
      cut a boy off: no, not even Brittles here; not for all the plate in the
      county, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the point,&rsquo; said the doctor, mysteriously. &lsquo;Mr. Giles, are you
      a Protestant?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir, I hope so,&rsquo; faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what are <i>you</i>, boy?&rsquo; said the doctor, turning sharply upon
      Brittles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord bless me, sir!&rsquo; replied Brittles, starting violently; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m the same
      as Mr. Giles, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then tell me this,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;both of you, both of you! Are you
      going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is the boy
      that was put through the little window last night? Out with it! Come! We
      are prepared for you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered
      creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger,
      that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and
      excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?&rsquo; said the doctor,
      shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the
      bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy&rsquo;s
      utmost acuteness. &lsquo;Something may come of this before long.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of office:
      which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a simple question of identity, you will observe,&rsquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what it is, sir,&rsquo; replied the constable, coughing with great
      violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had gone
      the wrong way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s the house broken into,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;and a couple of men
      catch one moment&rsquo;s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke, and
      in all the distraction of alarm and darkness. Here&rsquo;s a boy comes to that
      very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have his arm tied
      up, these men lay violent hands upon him&mdash;by doing which, they place
      his life in great danger&mdash;and swear he is the thief. Now, the
      question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not, in what
      situation do they place themselves?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The constable nodded profoundly. He said, if that wasn&rsquo;t law, he would be
      glad to know what was.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask you again,&rsquo; thundered the doctor, &lsquo;are you, on your solemn oaths,
      able to identify that boy?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at
      Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the reply;
      the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the doctor glanced
      keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at the same moment,
      the sound of wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s the runners!&rsquo; cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The what?&rsquo; exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Bow Street officers, sir,&rsquo; replied Brittles, taking up a candle; &lsquo;me
      and Mr. Giles sent for &lsquo;em this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Brittles; &lsquo;I sent a message up by the coachman, and I only
      wonder they weren&rsquo;t here before, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did, did you? Then confound your&mdash;slow coaches down here; that&rsquo;s
      all,&rsquo; said the doctor, walking away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXI &mdash; INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION
    </h2>
    <h3>
      &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with the
      chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open the door,&rsquo; replied a man outside; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the officers from Bow
      Street, as was sent to to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full
      width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in, without
      saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly as if he
      lived there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?&rsquo; said the
      officer; &lsquo;he&rsquo;s in the gig, a-minding the prad. Have you got a coach &lsquo;us
      here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building, the
      portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his companion to
      put up the gig: while Brittles lighted them, in a state of great
      admiration. This done, they returned to the house, and, being shown into a
      parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed like what they
      were.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle
      height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close;
      half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes. The other was a red-headed,
      bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured countenance, and a
      turned-up sinister-looking nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?&rsquo; said the
      stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on
      the table. &lsquo;Oh! Good-evening, master. Can I have a word or two with you in
      private, if you please?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that
      gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and
      shut the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the lady of the house,&rsquo; said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards Mrs.
      Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Blathers made a bow. Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on the
      floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same. The latter
      gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good society, or
      quite so much at his ease in it&mdash;one of the two&mdash;seated himself,
      after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and the head of
      his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,&rsquo; said Blathers. &lsquo;What are
      the circumstances?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0151.jpg" alt="0151" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0151.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at
      great length, and with much circumlocution. Messrs. Blathers and Duff
      looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,&rsquo; said Blathers;
      &lsquo;but my opinion at once is,&mdash;I don&rsquo;t mind committing myself to that
      extent,&mdash;that this wasn&rsquo;t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied Duff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I
      apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a
      countryman?&rsquo; said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, master,&rsquo; replied Blathers. &lsquo;This is all about the robbery, is
      it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All,&rsquo; replied the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking
      on?&rsquo; said Blathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing at all,&rsquo; replied the doctor. &lsquo;One of the frightened servants
      chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this
      attempt to break into the house; but it&rsquo;s nonsense: sheer absurdity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery easy disposed of, if it is,&rsquo; remarked Duff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What he says is quite correct,&rsquo; observed Blathers, nodding his head in a
      confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if they
      were a pair of castanets. &lsquo;Who is the boy? What account does he give of
      himself? Where did he come from? He didn&rsquo;t drop out of the clouds, did he,
      master?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course not,&rsquo; replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two
      ladies. &lsquo;I know his whole history: but we can talk about that presently.
      You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves made their
      attempt, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Blathers. &lsquo;We had better inspect the premises
      first, and examine the servants afterwards. That&rsquo;s the usual way of doing
      business.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by the
      native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short, went into
      the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at the window;
      and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in at the window;
      and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the shutter with; and
      after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with; and after that, a
      pitchfork to poke the bushes with. This done, amidst the breathless
      interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr. Giles and Brittles
      were put through a melodramatic representation of their share in the
      previous night&rsquo;s adventures: which they performed some six times over:
      contradicting each other, in not more than one important respect, the
      first time, and in not more than a dozen the last. This consummation being
      arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared the room, and held a long council
      together, compared with which, for secrecy and solemnity, a consultation
      of great doctors on the knottiest point in medicine, would be mere child&rsquo;s
      play.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy
      state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word,&rsquo; he said, making a halt, after a great number of very rapid
      turns, &lsquo;I hardly know what to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely,&rsquo; said Rose, &lsquo;the poor child&rsquo;s story, faithfully repeated to these
      men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I doubt it, my dear young lady,&rsquo; said the doctor, shaking his head. &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal
      functionaries of a higher grade. What is he, after all, they would say? A
      runaway. Judged by mere worldly considerations and probabilities, his
      story is a very doubtful one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You believe it, surely?&rsquo; interrupted Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>I</i> believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool
      for doing so,&rsquo; rejoined the doctor; &lsquo;but I don&rsquo;t think it is exactly the
      tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; demanded Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, my pretty cross-examiner,&rsquo; replied the doctor: &lsquo;because, viewed
      with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can only prove
      the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well. Confound the
      fellows, they <i>will</i> have the why and the wherefore, and will take
      nothing for granted. On his own showing, you see, he has been the
      companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried to a
      police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman&rsquo;s pocket; he has been
      taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman&rsquo;s house, to a place which he
      cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he has not the
      remotest idea. He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who seem to have
      taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and is put through a
      window to rob a house; and then, just at the very moment when he is going
      to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing that would set him all to
      rights, there rushes into the way, a blundering dog of a half-bred butler,
      and shoots him! As if on purpose to prevent his doing any good for
      himself! Don&rsquo;t you see all this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see it, of course,&rsquo; replied Rose, smiling at the doctor&rsquo;s impetuosity;
      &lsquo;but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the poor child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the doctor; &lsquo;of course not! Bless the bright eyes of your
      sex! They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side of any
      question; and that is, always, the one which first presents itself to
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his hands
      into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even greater
      rapidity than before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The more I think of it,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;the more I see that it will
      occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in possession
      of the boy&rsquo;s real story. I am certain it will not be believed; and even if
      they can do nothing to him in the end, still the dragging it forward, and
      giving publicity to all the doubts that will be cast upon it, must
      interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan of rescuing him from
      misery.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! what is to be done?&rsquo; cried Rose. &lsquo;Dear, dear! why did they send for
      these people?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, indeed!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Maylie. &lsquo;I would not have had them here, for
      the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All I know is,&rsquo; said Mr. Losberne, at last: sitting down with a kind of
      desperate calmness, &lsquo;that we must try and carry it off with a bold face.
      The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse. The boy has strong
      symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be talked to any
      more; that&rsquo;s one comfort. We must make the best of it; and if bad be the
      best, it is no fault of ours. Come in!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, master,&rsquo; said Blathers, entering the room followed by his
      colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. &lsquo;This warn&rsquo;t
      a put-up thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what the devil&rsquo;s a put-up thing?&rsquo; demanded the doctor, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,&rsquo; said Blathers, turning to them, as
      if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor&rsquo;s, &lsquo;when
      the servants is in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody suspected them, in this case,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery likely not, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; replied Blathers; &lsquo;but they might have been in
      it, for all that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;More likely on that wery account,&rsquo; said Duff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We find it was a town hand,&rsquo; said Blathers, continuing his report; &lsquo;for
      the style of work is first-rate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wery pretty indeed it is,&rsquo; remarked Duff, in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There was two of &lsquo;em in it,&rsquo; continued Blathers; &lsquo;and they had a boy with
      &lsquo;em; that&rsquo;s plain from the size of the window. That&rsquo;s all to be said at
      present. We&rsquo;ll see this lad that you&rsquo;ve got upstairs at once, if you
      please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?&rsquo; said the
      doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! to be sure!&rsquo; exclaimed Rose, eagerly. &lsquo;You shall have it immediately,
      if you will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, thank you, miss!&rsquo; said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across his
      mouth; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s dry work, this sort of duty. Anythink that&rsquo;s handy, miss;
      don&rsquo;t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What shall it be?&rsquo; asked the doctor, following the young lady to the
      sideboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little drop of spirits, master, if it&rsquo;s all the same,&rsquo; replied
      Blathers. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a cold ride from London, ma&rsquo;am; and I always find that
      spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who received
      it very graciously. While it was being conveyed to her, the doctor slipped
      out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Blathers: not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but
      grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand: and
      placing it in front of his chest; &lsquo;I have seen a good many pieces of
      business like this, in my time, ladies.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,&rsquo; said Mr. Duff,
      assisting his colleague&rsquo;s memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That was something in this way, warn&rsquo;t it?&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Blathers; &lsquo;that
      was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You always gave that to him&rsquo; replied Duff. &lsquo;It was the Family Pet, I tell
      you. Conkey hadn&rsquo;t any more to do with it than I had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get out!&rsquo; retorted Mr. Blathers; &lsquo;I know better. Do you mind that time
      when Conkey was robbed of his money, though? What a start that was! Better
      than any novel-book <i>I</i> ever see!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What was that?&rsquo; inquired Rose: anxious to encourage any symptoms of
      good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down upon,&rsquo; 
      said Blathers. &lsquo;This here Conkey Chickweed&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Conkey means Nosey, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; interposed Duff.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course the lady knows that, don&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; demanded Mr. Blathers. &lsquo;Always
      interrupting, you are, partner! This here Conkey Chickweed, miss, kept a
      public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar, where a good many
      young lords went to see cock-fighting, and badger-drawing, and that; and a
      wery intellectual manner the sports was conducted in, for I&rsquo;ve seen &lsquo;em
      off&rsquo;en. He warn&rsquo;t one of the family, at that time; and one night he was
      robbed of three hundred and twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was
      stole out of his bedroom in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black
      patch over his eye, who had concealed himself under the bed, and after
      committing the robbery, jumped slap out of window: which was only a story
      high. He was wery quick about it. But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired
      a blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a
      hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about &lsquo;em, found that
      Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way to
      some palings a good distance off; and there they lost &lsquo;em. However, he had
      made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr. Chickweed,
      licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other bankrupts; and
      all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don&rsquo;t know what all, was
      got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state of mind about his
      loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or four days, a pulling
      his hair off in such a desperate manner that many people was afraid he
      might be going to make away with himself. One day he came up to the
      office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview with the magistrate,
      who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and orders Jem Spyers in (Jem
      was a active officer), and tells him to go and assist Mr. Chickweed in
      apprehending the man as robbed his house. &ldquo;I see him, Spyers,&rdquo; said
      Chickweed, &ldquo;pass my house yesterday morning,&rdquo; &ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you up, and
      collar him!&rdquo; says Spyers. &ldquo;I was so struck all of a heap, that you might
      have fractured my skull with a toothpick,&rdquo; says the poor man; &ldquo;but we&rsquo;re
      sure to have him; for between ten and eleven o&rsquo;clock at night he passed
      again.&rdquo; Spyers no sooner heard this, than he put some clean linen and a
      comb, in his pocket, in case he should have to stop a day or two; and away
      he goes, and sets himself down at one of the public-house windows behind
      the little red curtain, with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a
      moment&rsquo;s notice. He was smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of
      a sudden Chickweed roars out, &ldquo;Here he is! Stop thief! Murder!&rdquo; Jem Spyers
      dashes out; and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full
      cry. Away goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people;
      everybody roars out, &ldquo;Thieves!&rdquo; and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting,
      all the time, like mad. Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a
      corner; shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; &ldquo;Which is the man?&rdquo;
       &ldquo;D&mdash;me!&rdquo; says Chickweed, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost him again!&rdquo; It was a remarkable
      occurrence, but he warn&rsquo;t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the
      public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out,
      from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his eye,
      till his own two eyes ached again. At last, he couldn&rsquo;t help shutting &lsquo;em,
      to ease &lsquo;em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he hears Chickweed
      a-roaring out, &ldquo;Here he is!&rdquo; Off he starts once more, with Chickweed
      half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice as long a run as
      the yesterday&rsquo;s one, the man&rsquo;s lost again! This was done, once or twice
      more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that Mr. Chickweed had been
      robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with him arterwards; and the
      other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone mad with grief.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did Jem Spyers say?&rsquo; inquired the doctor; who had returned to the
      room shortly after the commencement of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jem Spyers,&rsquo; resumed the officer, &lsquo;for a long time said nothing at all,
      and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he understood
      his business. But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and taking out his
      snuffbox, says &ldquo;Chickweed, I&rsquo;ve found out who done this here robbery.&rdquo;
       &ldquo;Have you?&rdquo; said Chickweed. &ldquo;Oh, my dear Spyers, only let me have
      wengeance, and I shall die contented! Oh, my dear Spyers, where is the
      villain!&rdquo; &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; said Spyers, offering him a pinch of snuff, &ldquo;none of
      that gammon! You did it yourself.&rdquo; So he had; and a good bit of money he
      had made by it, too; and nobody would never have found it out, if he
      hadn&rsquo;t been so precious anxious to keep up appearances!&rsquo; said Mr.
      Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and clinking the handcuffs
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very curious, indeed,&rsquo; observed the doctor. &lsquo;Now, if you please, you can
      walk upstairs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If <i>you</i> please, sir,&rsquo; returned Mr. Blathers. Closely following Mr.
      Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver&rsquo;s bedroom; Mr. Giles
      preceding the party, with a lighted candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he
      had appeared yet. Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up in
      bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all
      understanding what was going forward&mdash;in fact, without seeming to
      recollect where he was, or what had been passing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence
      notwithstanding, &lsquo;this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a
      spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d&rsquo; ye-call-him&rsquo;s grounds,
      at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this morning, and is
      immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that ingenious gentleman with
      the candle in his hand: who has placed his life in considerable danger, as
      I can professionally certify.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus recommended
      to their notice. The bewildered butler gazed from them towards Oliver, and
      from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most ludicrous mixture of fear
      and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to deny that, I suppose?&rsquo; said the doctor, laying Oliver
      gently down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was all done for the&mdash;for the best, sir,&rsquo; answered Giles. &lsquo;I am
      sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn&rsquo;t have meddled with him. I am
      not of an inhuman disposition, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thought it was what boy?&rsquo; inquired the senior officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The housebreaker&rsquo;s boy, sir!&rsquo; replied Giles. &lsquo;They&mdash;they certainly
      had a boy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well? Do you think so now?&rsquo; inquired Blathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think what, now?&rsquo; replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Think it&rsquo;s the same boy, Stupid-head?&rsquo; rejoined Blathers, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know; I really don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; said Giles, with a rueful
      countenance. &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t swear to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think?&rsquo; asked Mr. Blathers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what to think,&rsquo; replied poor Giles. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is the
      boy; indeed, I&rsquo;m almost certain that it isn&rsquo;t. You know it can&rsquo;t be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has this man been a-drinking, sir?&rsquo; inquired Blathers, turning to the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!&rsquo; said Duff, addressing Mr.
      Giles, with supreme contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient&rsquo;s pulse during this short
      dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked,
      that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would perhaps
      like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring apartment,
      where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and his respected
      superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions and
      impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on anything, but
      the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed, his declarations
      that he shouldn&rsquo;t know the real boy, if he were put before him that
      instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he, because Mr. Giles had
      said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes previously, admitted in
      the kitchen, that he began to be very much afraid he had been a little too
      hasty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether Mr.
      Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow pistol to
      that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more destructive loading
      than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which made a considerable
      impression on everybody but the doctor, who had drawn the ball about ten
      minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it make a greater impression
      than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after labouring, for some hours, under the
      fear of having mortally wounded a fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this
      new idea, and favoured it to the utmost. Finally, the officers, without
      troubling themselves very much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable
      in the house, and took up their rest for that night in the town; promising
      to return the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were in
      the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under suspicious
      circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff journeyed
      accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving themselves,
      on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been discovered
      sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is only
      punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the English
      law, and its comprehensive love of all the King&rsquo;s subjects, held to be no
      satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence, that the
      sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with violence,
      and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the punishment of death;
      Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise as they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more conversation,
      a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the joint bail of
      Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver&rsquo;s appearance if he should ever be
      called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded with a couple of
      guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the subject of their
      expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature consideration of all the
      circumstances, inclining to the belief that the burglarious attempt had
      originated with the Family Pet; and the former being equally disposed to
      concede the full merit of it to the great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care of
      Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne. If fervent prayers,
      gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in heaven&mdash;and
      if they be not, what prayers are!&mdash;the blessings which the orphan
      child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing peace and
      happiness.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXII &mdash; OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND
      FRIENDS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Oliver&rsquo;s ailings were neither slight nor few. In addition to the pain and
      delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold had
      brought on fever and ague: which hung about him for many weeks, and
      reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to get
      better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words, how
      deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how ardently he
      hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do something to
      show his gratitude; only something, which would let them see the love and
      duty with which his breast was full; something, however slight, which
      would prove to them that their gentle kindness had not been cast away; but
      that the poor boy whom their charity had rescued from misery, or death,
      was eager to serve them with his whole heart and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor fellow!&rsquo; said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly endeavouring
      to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale lips; &lsquo;you shall
      have many opportunities of serving us, if you will. We are going into the
      country, and my aunt intends that you shall accompany us. The quiet place,
      the pure air, and all the pleasure and beauties of spring, will restore
      you in a few days. We will employ you in a hundred ways, when you can bear
      the trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The trouble!&rsquo; cried Oliver. &lsquo;Oh! dear lady, if I could but work for you;
      if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or watching
      your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make you happy;
      what would I give to do it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall give nothing at all,&rsquo; said Miss Maylie, smiling; &lsquo;for, as I
      told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only
      take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make me
      very happy indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Happy, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; cried Oliver; &lsquo;how kind of you to say so!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will make me happier than I can tell you,&rsquo; replied the young lady.
      &lsquo;To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing
      any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an
      unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness
      and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence, would
      delight me, more than you can well imagine. Do you understand me?&rsquo; she
      inquired, watching Oliver&rsquo;s thoughtful face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, ma&rsquo;am, yes!&rsquo; replied Oliver eagerly; &lsquo;but I was thinking that I
      am ungrateful now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To whom?&rsquo; inquired the young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care of
      me before,&rsquo; rejoined Oliver. &lsquo;If they knew how happy I am, they would be
      pleased, I am sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sure they would,&rsquo; rejoined Oliver&rsquo;s benefactress; &lsquo;and Mr. Losberne
      has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well enough to
      bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure. &lsquo;I
      don&rsquo;t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once
      again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the fatigue
      of this expedition. One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out, accordingly,
      in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie. When they came to
      Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a loud exclamation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with the boy?&rsquo; cried the doctor, as usual, all in a
      bustle. &lsquo;Do you see anything&mdash;hear anything&mdash;feel anything&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That, sir,&rsquo; cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. &lsquo;That
      house!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; well, what of it? Stop coachman. Pull up here,&rsquo; cried the doctor.
      &lsquo;What of the house, my man; eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The thieves&mdash;the house they took me to!&rsquo; whispered Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil it is!&rsquo; cried the doctor. &lsquo;Hallo, there! let me out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled out
      of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the deserted
      tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Halloa?&rsquo; said a little ugly hump-backed man: opening the door so
      suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick, nearly
      fell forward into the passage. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Matter!&rsquo; exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment&rsquo;s
      reflection. &lsquo;A good deal. Robbery is the matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;ll be Murder the matter, too,&rsquo; replied the hump-backed man, coolly,
      &lsquo;if you don&rsquo;t take your hands off. Do you hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear you,&rsquo; said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s&mdash;confound the fellow, what&rsquo;s his rascally name&mdash;Sikes;
      that&rsquo;s it. Where&rsquo;s Sikes, you thief?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and indignation;
      then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor&rsquo;s grasp, growled
      forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the house. Before he
      could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed into the parlour,
      without a word of parley.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige of
      anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the cupboards;
      answered Oliver&rsquo;s description!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now!&rsquo; said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, &lsquo;what do you
      mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to rob me,
      or to murder me? Which is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair, you
      ridiculous old vampire?&rsquo; said the irritable doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want, then?&rsquo; demanded the hunchback. &lsquo;Will you take yourself
      off, before I do you a mischief? Curse you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As soon as I think proper,&rsquo; said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other
      parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to Oliver&rsquo;s
      account of it. &lsquo;I shall find you out, some day, my friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you?&rsquo; sneered the ill-favoured cripple. &lsquo;If you ever want me, I&rsquo;m
      here. I haven&rsquo;t lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty years,
      to be scared by you. You shall pay for this; you shall pay for this.&rsquo; And
      so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and danced upon the
      ground, as if wild with rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stupid enough, this,&rsquo; muttered the doctor to himself; &lsquo;the boy must have
      made a mistake. Here! Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself up
      again.&rsquo; With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money, and
      returned to the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations
      and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the driver,
      he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant with a glance
      so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and vindictive, that,
      waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months afterwards. He
      continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until the driver had
      resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their way, they could
      see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the ground, and
      tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am an ass!&rsquo; said the doctor, after a long silence. &lsquo;Did you know that
      before, Oliver?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then don&rsquo;t forget it another time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An ass,&rsquo; said the doctor again, after a further silence of some minutes.
      &lsquo;Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows had been
      there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had assistance,
      I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my own exposure,
      and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I have hushed up this
      business. That would have served me right, though. I am always involving
      myself in some scrape or other, by acting on impulse. It might have done
      me good.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon anything
      but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment to the
      nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from being involved
      in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the warmest respect and
      esteem of all who knew him. If the truth must be told, he was a little out
      of temper, for a minute or two, at being disappointed in procuring
      corroborative evidence of Oliver&rsquo;s story on the very first occasion on
      which he had a chance of obtaining any. He soon came round again, however;
      and finding that Oliver&rsquo;s replies to his questions, were still as
      straightforward and consistent, and still delivered with as much apparent
      sincerity and truth, as they had ever been, he made up his mind to attach
      full credence to them, from that time forth.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided, they
      were enabled to drive straight thither. When the coach turned into it, his
      heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, my boy, which house is it?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Losberne.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That! That!&rsquo; replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window. &lsquo;The
      white house. Oh! make haste! Pray make haste! I feel as if I should die:
      it makes me tremble so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come!&rsquo; said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. &lsquo;You will
      see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! I hope so!&rsquo; cried Oliver. &lsquo;They were so good to me; so very, very
      good to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The coach rolled on. It stopped. No; that was the wrong house; the next
      door. It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up at the
      windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window. &lsquo;To
      Let.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Knock at the next door,&rsquo; cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver&rsquo;s arm in his.
      &lsquo;What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the adjoining house,
      do you know?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The servant did not know; but would go and inquire. She presently
      returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone to
      the West Indies, six weeks before. Oliver clasped his hands, and sank
      feebly backward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has his housekeeper gone too?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment&rsquo;s
      pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir&rsquo;; replied the servant. &lsquo;The old gentleman, the housekeeper, and
      a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s, all went together.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then turn towards home again,&rsquo; said Mr. Losberne to the driver; &lsquo;and
      don&rsquo;t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded
      London!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The book-stall keeper, sir?&rsquo; said Oliver. &lsquo;I know the way there. See him,
      pray, sir! Do see him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,&rsquo; said the doctor.
      &lsquo;Quite enough for both of us. If we go to the book-stall keeper&rsquo;s, we
      shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house on fire, or run
      away. No; home again straight!&rsquo; And in obedience to the doctor&rsquo;s impulse,
      home they went.
    </p>
    <p>
      This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in
      the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times during
      his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs. Bedwin would
      say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how many long days
      and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had done for him, and
      in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope of eventually
      clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he had been forced
      away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many of his recent
      trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so far, and carried
      with them the belief that he was an impostor and a robber&mdash;a belief
      which might remain uncontradicted to his dying day&mdash;was almost more
      than he could bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of
      his benefactors. After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather had
      fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young leaves
      and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house at
      Chertsey, for some months.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin&rsquo;s cupidity, to the banker&rsquo;s;
      and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house, they departed
      to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took Oliver with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft
      tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green
      hills and rich woods, of an inland village! Who can tell how scenes of
      peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close and
      noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded hearts!
      Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives of toil, and
      who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has indeed been
      second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick and stone that
      formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even they, with the
      hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at last for one short
      glimpse of Nature&rsquo;s face; and, carried far from the scenes of their old
      pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once into a new state of
      being. Crawling forth, from day to day, to some green sunny spot, they
      have had such memories wakened up within them by the sight of the sky, and
      hill and plain, and glistening water, that a foretaste of heaven itself
      has soothed their quick decline, and they have sunk into their tombs, as
      peacefully as the sun whose setting they watched from their lonely chamber
      window but a few hours before, faded from their dim and feeble sight! The
      memories which peaceful country scenes call up, are not of this world, nor
      of its thoughts and hopes. Their gentle influence may teach us how to
      weave fresh garlands for the graves of those we loved: may purify our
      thoughts, and bear down before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all
      this, there lingers, in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed
      consciousness of having held such feelings long before, in some remote and
      distant time, which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and
      bends down pride and worldliness beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lovely spot to which they repaired. Oliver, whose days had been
      spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and brawling, seemed
      to enter on a new existence there. The rose and honeysuckle clung to the
      cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks of the trees; and the
      garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious odours. Hard by, was a
      little churchyard; not crowded with tall unsightly gravestones, but full
      of humble mounds, covered with fresh turf and moss: beneath which, the old
      people of the village lay at rest. Oliver often wandered here; and,
      thinking of the wretched grave in which his mother lay, would sometimes
      sit him down and sob unseen; but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky
      overhead, he would cease to think of her as lying in the ground, and would
      weep for her, sadly, but without pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a happy time. The days were peaceful and serene; the nights brought
      with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched prison, or
      associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and happy thoughts.
      Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman, who lived near the
      little church: who taught him to read better, and to write: and who spoke
      so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could never try enough to
      please him. Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie and Rose, and hear them
      talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in some shady place, and listen
      whilst the young lady read: which he could have done, until it grew too
      dark to see the letters. Then, he had his own lesson for the next day to
      prepare; and at this, he would work hard, in a little room which looked
      into the garden, till evening came slowly on, when the ladies would walk
      out again, and he with them: listening with such pleasure to all they
      said: and so happy if they wanted a flower that he could climb to reach,
      or had forgotten anything he could run to fetch: that he could never be
      quick enough about it. When it became quite dark, and they returned home,
      the young lady would sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or
      sing, in a low and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt
      to hear. There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and
      Oliver would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a
      perfect rapture.
    </p>
    <p>
      And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way in
      which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the other
      days in that most happy time! There was the little church, in the morning,
      with the green leaves fluttering at the windows: the birds singing
      without: and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the low porch, and
      filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor people were so
      neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that it seemed a
      pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there together; and though
      the singing might be rude, it was real, and sounded more musical (to
      Oliver&rsquo;s ears at least) than any he had ever heard in church before. Then,
      there were the walks as usual, and many calls at the clean houses of the
      labouring men; and at night, Oliver read a chapter or two from the Bible,
      which he had been studying all the week, and in the performance of which
      duty he felt more proud and pleased, than if he had been the clergyman
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o&rsquo;clock, roaming the fields,
      and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild flowers,
      with which he would return laden, home; and which it took great care and
      consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the embellishment of
      the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too, for Miss Maylie&rsquo;s
      birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the subject under the able
      tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the cages, in the most
      approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce and smart for the day,
      there was usually some little commission of charity to execute in the
      village; or, failing that, there was rare cricket-playing, sometimes, on
      the green; or, failing that, there was always something to do in the
      garden, or about the plants, to which Oliver (who had studied this science
      also, under the same master, who was a gardener by trade,) applied himself
      with hearty good-will, until Miss Rose made her appearance: when there
      were a thousand commendations to be bestowed on all he had done.
    </p>
    <p>
      So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the most
      blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled happiness, and
      which, in Oliver&rsquo;s were true felicity. With the purest and most amiable
      generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest, soul-felt gratitude on
      the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of that short time, Oliver
      Twist had become completely domesticated with the old lady and her niece,
      and that the fervent attachment of his young and sensitive heart, was
      repaid by their pride in, and attachment to, himself.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIII &mdash; WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS,
      EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN CHECK
    </h2>
    <p>
      Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came. If the village had been beautiful
      at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its richness. The
      great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the earlier months, had
      now burst into strong life and health; and stretching forth their green
      arms over the thirsty ground, converted open and naked spots into choice
      nooks, where was a deep and pleasant shade from which to look upon the
      wide prospect, steeped in sunshine, which lay stretched beyond. The earth
      had donned her mantle of brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes
      abroad. It was the prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and
      flourishing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same
      cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates. Oliver had long since grown
      stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in his warm
      feelings of a great many people. He was still the same gentle, attached,
      affectionate creature that he had been when pain and suffering had wasted
      his strength, and when he was dependent for every slight attention, and
      comfort on those who tended him.
    </p>
    <p>
      One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was customary
      with them: for the day had been unusually warm, and there was a brilliant
      moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was unusually refreshing. Rose
      had been in high spirits, too, and they had walked on, in merry
      conversation, until they had far exceeded their ordinary bounds. Mrs.
      Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly home. The young lady
      merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down to the piano as usual.
      After running abstractedly over the keys for a few minutes, she fell into
      a low and very solemn air; and as she played it, they heard a sound as if
      she were weeping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rose, my dear!&rsquo; said the elder lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words had
      roused her from some painful thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rose, my love!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over her.
      &lsquo;What is this? In tears! My dear child, what distresses you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, aunt; nothing,&rsquo; replied the young lady. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it
      is; I can&rsquo;t describe it; but I feel&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not ill, my love?&rsquo; interposed Mrs. Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no! Oh, not ill!&rsquo; replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly
      chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; &lsquo;I shall be better
      presently. Close the window, pray!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver hastened to comply with her request. The young lady, making an
      effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune; but
      her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with her
      hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she was now
      unable to repress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My child!&rsquo; said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, &lsquo;I never
      saw you so before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,&rsquo; rejoined Rose; &lsquo;but indeed I
      have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I <i>am</i> ill, aunt.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the very
      short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of her
      countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had lost
      nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an anxious
      haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn before.
      Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush: and a heavy
      wildness came over the soft blue eye. Again this disappeared, like the
      shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was alarmed
      by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that she
      affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and they so
      far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to retire for the
      night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in better health:
      assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in the morning, quite
      well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, &lsquo;that nothing is the
      matter? She don&rsquo;t look well to-night, but&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in a
      dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length, she
      said, in a trembling voice:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope not, Oliver. I have been very happy with her for some years: too
      happy, perhaps. It may be time that I should meet with some misfortune;
      but I hope it is not this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; inquired Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The heavy blow,&rsquo; said the old lady, &lsquo;of losing the dear girl who has so
      long been my comfort and happiness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! God forbid!&rsquo; exclaimed Oliver, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Amen to that, my child!&rsquo; said the old lady, wringing her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?&rsquo; said Oliver. &lsquo;Two
      hours ago, she was quite well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is very ill now,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Maylies; &lsquo;and will be worse, I am
      sure. My dear, dear Rose! Oh, what shall I do without her!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own
      emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that,
      for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And consider, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into
      his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. &lsquo;Oh! consider how young
      and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all about her.
      I am sure&mdash;certain&mdash;quite certain&mdash;that, for your sake, who
      are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she makes
      so happy; she will not die. Heaven will never let her die so young.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver&rsquo;s head. &lsquo;You think
      like a child, poor boy. But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding. I had
      forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned, for I am
      old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the agony of
      separation from the objects of our love. I have seen enough, too, to know
      that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared to those that
      love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow; for Heaven is
      just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there is a brighter
      world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy. God&rsquo;s will be done!
      I love her; and He knows how well!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she
      checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself up
      as she spoke, became composed and firm. He was still more astonished to
      find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the care and watching
      which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and collected: performing all the
      duties which had devolved upon her, steadily, and, to all external
      appearances, even cheerfully. But he was young, and did not know what
      strong minds are capable of, under trying circumstances. How should he,
      when their possessors so seldom know themselves?
    </p>
    <p>
      An anxious night ensued. When morning came, Mrs. Maylie&rsquo;s predictions were
      but too well verified. Rose was in the first stage of a high and dangerous
      fever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into his
      face; &lsquo;this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to Mr.
      Losberne. It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more than
      four miles off, by the footpath across the field: and thence dispatched,
      by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The people at the inn
      will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to see it done, I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is another letter,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; &lsquo;but
      whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I scarcely
      know. I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it for Chertsey, too, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; inquired Oliver; impatient to execute
      his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver glanced
      at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire, at some
      great lord&rsquo;s house in the country; where, he could not make out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall it go, ma&rsquo;am?&rsquo; asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think not,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back. &lsquo;I will wait until
      to-morrow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off, without
      more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.
    </p>
    <p>
      Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which
      sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either side,
      and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers were
      busy at their work: nor did he stop once, save now and then, for a few
      seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and covered
      with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here he paused, and looked about for the inn. There were a white bank, and
      a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was a large
      house, with all the wood about it painted green: before which was the sign
      of &lsquo;The George.&rsquo; To this he hastened, as soon as it caught his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after
      hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing all
      he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall
      gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots with
      tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking his
      teeth with a silver toothpick.
    </p>
    <p>
      This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out the
      bill: which took a long time making out: and after it was ready, and paid,
      a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which took up ten good
      minutes more. Meanwhile Oliver was in such a desperate state of impatience
      and anxiety, that he felt as if he could have jumped upon the horse
      himself, and galloped away, full tear, to the next stage. At length, all
      was ready; and the little parcel having been handed up, with many
      injunctions and entreaties for its speedy delivery, the man set spurs to
      his horse, and rattling over the uneven paving of the market-place, was
      out of the town, and galloping along the turnpike-road, in a couple of
      minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and that
      no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a somewhat
      lighter heart. He was turning out of the gateway when he accidently
      stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at that moment
      coming out of the inn door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hah!&rsquo; cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly recoiling.
      &lsquo;What the devil&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, sir,&rsquo; said Oliver; &lsquo;I was in a great hurry to get
      home, and didn&rsquo;t see you were coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Death!&rsquo; muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large
      dark eyes. &lsquo;Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He&rsquo;d start up
      from a stone coffin, to come in my way!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry,&rsquo; stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man&rsquo;s wild look.
      &lsquo;I hope I have not hurt you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rot you!&rsquo; murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his clenched
      teeth; &lsquo;if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might have been
      free of you in a night. Curses on your head, and black death on your
      heart, you imp! What are you doing here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He
      advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at him,
      but fell violently on the ground: writhing and foaming, in a fit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he
      supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help. Having seen
      him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards, running
      as fast as he could, to make up for lost time: and recalling with a great
      deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary behaviour of the
      person from whom he had just parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for when
      he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and to drive
      all considerations of self completely from his memory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was delirious. A
      medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in constant attendance
      upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he had taken Mrs. Maylie
      aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a most alarming nature.
      &lsquo;In fact,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;it would be little short of a miracle, if she
      recovered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out, with
      noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest sound from
      the sick chamber! How often did a tremble shake his frame, and cold drops
      of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling of feet caused him
      to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had even then occurred!
      And what had been the fervency of all the prayers he had ever muttered,
      compared with those he poured forth, now, in the agony and passion of his
      supplication for the life and health of the gentle creature, who was
      tottering on the deep grave&rsquo;s verge!
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by while
      the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance! Oh! the
      racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat
      violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they
      conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety <i>to be doing something</i>
      to relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to
      alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of
      our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what reflections
      or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time, allay them!
    </p>
    <p>
      Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke in
      whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time; women and
      children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for hours after it
      had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the garden, raising his
      eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and shuddering to see the darkened
      window, looking as if death lay stretched inside. Late that night, Mr.
      Losberne arrived. &lsquo;It is hard,&rsquo; said the good doctor, turning away as he
      spoke; &lsquo;so young; so much beloved; but there is very little hope.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another morning. The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked upon
      no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom about
      her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy, surrounding her
      on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting fast. Oliver crept
      away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one of the green mounds,
      wept and prayed for her, in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and
      mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the
      summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering
      overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy raised
      his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively occurred to
      him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could surely never die
      when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that graves were for cold
      and cheerless winter: not for sunlight and fragrance. He almost thought
      that shrouds were for the old and shrunken; and that they never wrapped
      the young and graceful form in their ghastly folds.
    </p>
    <p>
      A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.
      Another! Again! It was tolling for the funeral service. A group of humble
      mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse was
      young. They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother&mdash;a
      mother once&mdash;among the weeping train. But the sun shone brightly, and
      the birds sang on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received
      from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that he
      might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was. He had no
      cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of thought, for
      he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred little occasions
      rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have been more zealous,
      and more earnest, and wished he had been. We need be careful how we deal
      with those about us, when every death carries to some small circle of
      survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so little done&mdash;of so
      many things forgotten, and so many more which might have been repaired!
      There is no remorse so deep as that which is unavailing; if we would be
      spared its tortures, let us remember this, in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.
      Oliver&rsquo;s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside of
      her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven her
      away. He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which she
      would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell, and
      die.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours. The untasted meal was
      removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were elsewhere, they
      watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at length, cast over sky
      and earth those brilliant hues which herald his departure. Their quick
      ears caught the sound of an approaching footstep. They both involuntarily
      darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of Rose?&rsquo; cried the old lady. &lsquo;Tell me at once! I can bear it;
      anything but suspense! Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must compose yourself,&rsquo; said the doctor supporting her. &lsquo;Be calm, my
      dear ma&rsquo;am, pray.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go, in God&rsquo;s name! My dear child! She is dead! She is dying!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried the doctor, passionately. &lsquo;As He is good and merciful, she
      will live to bless us all, for years to come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but
      the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her
      first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were
      extended to receive her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXIV &mdash; CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A
      YOUNG GENTLEMAN WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH
      HAPPENED TO OLIVER
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was almost too much happiness to bear. Oliver felt stunned and
      stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak, or
      rest. He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had passed,
      until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of tears came
      to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a full sense of
      the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost insupportable load of
      anguish which had been taken from his breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward: laden with
      flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of the
      sick chamber. As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind him,
      the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace. Looking round,
      he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as the horses
      were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning against a gate
      until it should have passed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap,
      whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that he
      could not identify the person. In another second or two, the nightcap was
      thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice bellowed to the
      driver to stop: which he did, as soon as he could pull up his horses.
      Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same voice called Oliver
      by his name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; cried the voice. &lsquo;Oliver, what&rsquo;s the news? Miss Rose! Master
      O-li-ver!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is is you, Giles?&rsquo; cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply,
      when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the
      other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a word!&rsquo; cried the gentleman, &lsquo;Better or worse?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better&mdash;much better!&rsquo; replied Oliver, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank Heaven!&rsquo; exclaimed the gentleman. &lsquo;You are sure?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver. &lsquo;The change took place only a few hours ago;
      and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door, leaped
      out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are quite certain? There is no possibility of any mistake on your
      part, my boy, is there?&rsquo; demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice. &lsquo;Do
      not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would not for the world, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver. &lsquo;Indeed you may believe
      me. Mr. Losberne&rsquo;s words were, that she would live to bless us all for
      many years to come. I heard him say so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tears stood in Oliver&rsquo;s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the
      beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away,
      and remained silent, for some minutes. Oliver thought he heard him sob,
      more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh remark&mdash;for
      he could well guess what his feelings were&mdash;and so stood apart,
      feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting on
      the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and wiping his
      eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with white spots. That
      the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was abundantly
      demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the young
      gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you had better go on to my mother&rsquo;s in the chaise, Giles,&rsquo; said
      he. &lsquo;I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time before I
      see her. You can say I am coming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,&rsquo; said Giles: giving a final polish to his
      ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; &lsquo;but if you would leave the
      postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you. It wouldn&rsquo;t be
      proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should never have any
      more authority with them if they did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, &lsquo;you can do as you like. Let him
      go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us. Only
      first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering, or we
      shall be taken for madmen.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and pocketed
      his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape, which he
      took out of the chaise. This done, the postboy drove off; Giles, Mr.
      Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much interest
      and curiosity at the new comer. He seemed about five-and-twenty years of
      age, and was of the middle height; his countenance was frank and handsome;
      and his demeanor easy and prepossessing. Notwithstanding the difference
      between youth and age, he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that
      Oliver would have had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship,
      if he had not already spoken of her as his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached the
      cottage. The meeting did not take place without great emotion on both
      sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother!&rsquo; whispered the young man; &lsquo;why did you not write before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Maylie; &lsquo;but, on reflection, I determined to keep
      back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne&rsquo;s opinion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But why,&rsquo; said the young man, &lsquo;why run the chance of that occurring which
      so nearly happened? If Rose had&mdash;I cannot utter that word now&mdash;if
      this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever have forgiven
      yourself! How could I ever have know happiness again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If that <i>had</i> been the case, Harry,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &lsquo;I fear your
      happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival
      here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little
      import.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And who can wonder if it be so, mother?&rsquo; rejoined the young man; &lsquo;or why
      should I say, <i>if</i>?&mdash;It is&mdash;it is&mdash;you know it, mother&mdash;you
      must know it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can
      offer,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie; &lsquo;I know that the devotion and affection of her
      nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and lasting.
      If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed behaviour in one
      she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my task so difficult of
      performance, or have to encounter so many struggles in my own bosom, when
      I take what seems to me to be the strict line of duty.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is unkind, mother,&rsquo; said Harry. &lsquo;Do you still suppose that I am a
      boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own soul?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think, my dear son,&rsquo; returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his
      shoulder, &lsquo;that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and
      that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more
      fleeting. Above all, I think&rsquo; said the lady, fixing her eyes on her son&rsquo;s
      face, &lsquo;that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a wife on
      whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no fault of
      hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and upon his
      children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the world, be
      cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against him: he may, no
      matter how generous and good his nature, one day repent of the connection
      he formed in early life. And she may have the pain of knowing that he does
      so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mother,&rsquo; said the young man, impatiently, &lsquo;he would be a selfish brute,
      unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe, who acted
      thus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think so now, Harry,&rsquo; replied his mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And ever will!&rsquo; said the young man. &lsquo;The mental agony I have suffered,
      during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of a passion
      which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I have lightly
      formed. On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as firmly as ever
      heart of man was set on woman. I have no thought, no view, no hope in
      life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great stake, you take my
      peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to the wind. Mother,
      think better of this, and of me, and do not disregard the happiness of
      which you seem to think so little.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &lsquo;it is because I think so much of warm and
      sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we have
      said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it rest with Rose, then,&rsquo; interposed Harry. &lsquo;You will not press these
      overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle in my
      way?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not,&rsquo; rejoined Mrs. Maylie; &lsquo;but I would have you consider&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>have</i> considered!&rsquo; was the impatient reply; &lsquo;Mother, I have
      considered, years and years. I have considered, ever since I have been
      capable of serious reflection. My feelings remain unchanged, as they ever
      will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them vent,
      which can be productive of no earthly good? No! Before I leave this place,
      Rose shall hear me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She shall,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she will
      hear me coldly, mother,&rsquo; said the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not coldly,&rsquo; rejoined the old lady; &lsquo;far from it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How then?&rsquo; urged the young man. &lsquo;She has formed no other attachment?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, indeed,&rsquo; replied his mother; &lsquo;you have, or I mistake, too strong a
      hold on her affections already. What I would say,&rsquo; resumed the old lady,
      stopping her son as he was about to speak, &lsquo;is this. Before you stake your
      all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried to the
      highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child, on Rose&rsquo;s
      history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her doubtful birth may
      have on her decision: devoted as she is to us, with all the intensity of
      her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of self which, in all
      matters, great or trifling, has always been her characteristic.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I leave you to discover,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Maylie. &lsquo;I must go back to
      her. God bless you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall see you again to-night?&rsquo; said the young man, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By and by,&rsquo; replied the lady; &lsquo;when I leave Rose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will tell her I am here?&rsquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how I
      long to see her. You will not refuse to do this, mother?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said the old lady; &lsquo;I will tell her all.&rsquo; And pressing her son&rsquo;s
      hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment while
      this hurried conversation was proceeding. The former now held out his hand
      to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged between them. The
      doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious questions from his
      young friend, a precise account of his patient&rsquo;s situation; which was
      quite as consolatory and full of promise, as Oliver&rsquo;s statement had
      encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of which, Mr. Giles, who affected
      to be busy about the luggage, listened with greedy ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?&rsquo; inquired the doctor,
      when he had concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing particular, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?&rsquo; said the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None at all, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;I am sorry to hear it, because you do that sort
      of thing admirably. Pray, how is Brittles?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The boy is very well, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone of
      patronage; &lsquo;and sends his respectful duty, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s well,&rsquo; said the doctor. &lsquo;Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr. Giles,
      that on the day before that on which I was called away so hurriedly, I
      executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small commission in your
      favour. Just step into this corner a moment, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,
      and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on
      the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with
      steps of unusual stateliness. The subject matter of this conference was
      not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily enlightened
      concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and having called
      for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty, which was highly
      effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in consideration of his
      gallant behaviour on the occasion of that attempted robbery, to deposit,
      in the local savings-bank, the sum of five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole
      use and benefit. At this, the two women-servants lifted up their hands and
      eyes, and supposed that Mr. Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied,
      &lsquo;No, no&rsquo;; and that if they observed that he was at all haughty to his
      inferiors, he would thank them to tell him so. And then he made a great
      many other remarks, no less illustrative of his humility, which were
      received with equal favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and
      as much to the purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.
    </p>
    <p>
      Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for the
      doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful Harry
      Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the worthy
      gentleman&rsquo;s good humour, which displayed itself in a great variety of
      sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of small jokes,
      which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had ever heard, and
      caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident satisfaction of the
      doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and made Harry laugh almost
      as heartily, by the very force of sympathy. So, they were as pleasant a
      party as, under the circumstances, they could well have been; and it was
      late before they retired, with light and thankful hearts, to take that
      rest of which, after the doubt and suspense they had recently undergone,
      they stood much in need.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual
      occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many days.
      The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places; and the
      sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more gathered to
      gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had seemed to the sad
      eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over every object,
      beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic. The dew seemed to sparkle
      more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle among them with a
      sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue and bright. Such is
      the influence which the condition of our own thoughts, exercise, even over
      the appearance of external objects. Men who look on nature, and their
      fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and gloomy, are in the right; but the
      sombre colours are reflections from their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.
      The real hues are delicate, and need a clearer vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time,
      that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie,
      after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was
      seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in
      their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind. If Oliver were
      behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be found; and
      morning after morning they scoured the country together, and brought home
      the fairest that blossomed. The window of the young lady&rsquo;s chamber was
      opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer air stream in, and
      revive her with its freshness; but there always stood in water, just
      inside the lattice, one particular little bunch, which was made up with
      great care, every morning. Oliver could not help noticing that the
      withered flowers were never thrown away, although the little vase was
      regularly replenished; nor, could he help observing, that whenever the
      doctor came into the garden, he invariably cast his eyes up to that
      particular corner, and nodded his head most expressively, as he set forth
      on his morning&rsquo;s walk. Pending these observations, the days were flying
      by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor did Oliver&rsquo;s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady had
      not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now and
      then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself, with
      redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old
      gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even
      himself. It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was greatly
      startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his books,
      was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house. It was quite a
      cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of
      jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the
      place with their delicious perfume. It looked into a garden, whence a
      wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine meadow-land
      and wood. There was no other dwelling near, in that direction; and the
      prospect it commanded was very extensive.
    </p>
    <p>
      One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning to
      settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his books.
      He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had been
      uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is no
      disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say, that
      gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it
      holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things
      about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure. So far as an
      overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter inability
      to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called sleep, this is
      it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is going on about us,
      and, if we dream at such a time, words which are really spoken, or sounds
      which really exist at the moment, accommodate themselves with surprising
      readiness to our visions, until reality and imagination become so
      strangely blended that it is afterwards almost matter of impossibility to
      separate the two. Nor is this, the most striking phenomenon incidental to
      such a state. It is an undoubted fact, that although our senses of touch
      and sight be for the time dead, yet our sleeping thoughts, and the
      visionary scenes that pass before us, will be influenced and materially
      influenced, by the <i>mere silent presence</i> of some external object;
      which may not have been near us when we closed our eyes: and of whose
      vicinity we have had no waking consciousness.

    </h5>
    <p>
      Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that his
      books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was stirring
      among the creeping plants outside. And yet he was asleep. Suddenly, the
      scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he thought, with a
      glow of terror, that he was in the Jew&rsquo;s house again. There sat the
      hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at him, and whispering
      to another man, with his face averted, who sat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush, my dear!&rsquo; he thought he heard the Jew say; &lsquo;it is he, sure enough.
      Come away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He!&rsquo; the other man seemed to answer; &lsquo;could I mistake him, think you? If
      a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and he
      stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to point him
      out. If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across his grave, I
      fancy I should know, if there wasn&rsquo;t a mark above it, that he lay buried
      there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver awoke
      with the fear, and started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Good Heaven! what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his heart,
      and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move! There&mdash;there&mdash;at
      the window&mdash;close before him&mdash;so close, that he could have
      almost touched him before he started back: with his eyes peering into the
      room, and meeting his: there stood the Jew! And beside him, white with
      rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man who had
      accosted him in the inn-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they were
      gone. But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look was as
      firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply carved in
      stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed for a
      moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called loudly for
      help.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXV &mdash; CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER&rsquo;S
      ADVENTURE; AND A CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND
      ROSE
    </h2>
    <p>
      When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver&rsquo;s cries, hurried to the
      spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,
      pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely
      able to articulate the words, &lsquo;The Jew! the Jew!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry
      Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard
      Oliver&rsquo;s history from his mother, understood it at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What direction did he take?&rsquo; he asked, catching up a heavy stick which
      was standing in a corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That,&rsquo; replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; &lsquo;I
      missed them in an instant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, they are in the ditch!&rsquo; said Harry. &lsquo;Follow! And keep as near me,
      as you can.&rsquo; So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off with a
      speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the others to
      keep near him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the
      course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and
      just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking himself
      up with more agility than he could have been supposed to possess, struck
      into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting all the while,
      most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader,
      striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to
      search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time for
      the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to communicate to
      Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so vigorous a pursuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The search was all in vain. There were not even the traces of recent
      footsteps, to be seen. They stood now, on the summit of a little hill,
      commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.
      There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain
      that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must have
      made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could have
      accomplished in so short a time. A thick wood skirted the meadow-land in
      another direction; but they could not have gained that covert for the same
      reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must have been a dream, Oliver,&rsquo; said Harry Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh no, indeed, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver, shuddering at the very recollection
      of the old wretch&rsquo;s countenance; &lsquo;I saw him too plainly for that. I saw
      them both, as plainly as I see you now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who was the other?&rsquo; inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the
      inn,&rsquo; said Oliver. &lsquo;We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I
      could swear to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They took this way?&rsquo; demanded Harry: &lsquo;are you sure?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As I am that the men were at the window,&rsquo; replied Oliver, pointing down,
      as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from the
      meadow. &lsquo;The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew, running a few
      paces to the right, crept through that gap.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen watched Oliver&rsquo;s earnest face, as he spoke, and looking
      from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the accuracy of what
      he said. Still, in no direction were there any appearances of the
      trampling of men in hurried flight. The grass was long; but it was trodden
      down nowhere, save where their own feet had crushed it. The sides and
      brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but in no one place could they
      discern the print of men&rsquo;s shoes, or the slightest mark which would
      indicate that any feet had pressed the ground for hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is strange!&rsquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strange?&rsquo; echoed the doctor. &lsquo;Blathers and Duff, themselves, could make
      nothing of it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did not
      desist until the coming on of night rendered its further prosecution
      hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance. Giles was
      dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village, furnished with the
      best description Oliver could give of the appearance and dress of the
      strangers. Of these, the Jew was, at all events, sufficiently remarkable
      to be remembered, supposing he had been seen drinking, or loitering about;
      but Giles returned without any intelligence, calculated to dispel or
      lessen the mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but
      with no better success. On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie
      repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something of
      the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless. After a few days,
      the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when wonder, having
      no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering. She had left her room: was able to
      go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into the hearts
      of all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little circle;
      and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more heard in
      the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon some there:
      even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to remark. Mrs. Maylie
      and her son were often closeted together for a long time; and more than
      once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon her face. After Mr. Losberne
      had fixed a day for his departure to Chertsey, these symptoms increased;
      and it became evident that something was in progress which affected the
      peace of the young lady, and of somebody else besides.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour,
      Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to
      speak with her for a few moments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A few&mdash;a very few&mdash;will suffice, Rose,&rsquo; said the young man,
      drawing his chair towards her. &lsquo;What I shall have to say, has already
      presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are
      not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might
      have been the effect of her recent illness. She merely bowed; and bending
      over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;ought to have left here, before,&rsquo; said Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should, indeed,&rsquo; replied Rose. &lsquo;Forgive me for saying so, but I wish
      you had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all
      apprehensions,&rsquo; said the young man; &lsquo;the fear of losing the one dear being
      on whom my every wish and hope are fixed. You had been dying; trembling
      between earth and heaven. We know that when the young, the beautiful, and
      good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits insensibly turn
      towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know, Heaven help us! that
      the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade in blooming.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were
      spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and
      glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as
      though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred naturally,
      with the loveliest things in nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A creature,&rsquo; continued the young man, passionately, &lsquo;a creature as fair
      and innocent of guile as one of God&rsquo;s own angels, fluttered between life
      and death. Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to which she was
      akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to the sorrow and
      calamity of this! Rose, Rose, to know that you were passing away like some
      soft shadow, which a light from above, casts upon the earth; to have no
      hope that you would be spared to those who linger here; hardly to know a
      reason why you should be; to feel that you belonged to that bright sphere
      whither so many of the fairest and the best have winged their early
      flight; and yet to pray, amid all these consolations, that you might be
      restored to those who loved you&mdash;these were distractions almost too
      great to bear. They were mine, by day and night; and with them, came such
      a rushing torrent of fears, and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest
      you should die, and never know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore
      down sense and reason in its course. You recovered. Day by day, and almost
      hour by hour, some drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent
      and feeble stream of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled
      it again to a high and rushing tide. I have watched you change almost from
      death, to life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep
      affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has
      softened my heart to all mankind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did not mean that,&rsquo; said Rose, weeping; &lsquo;I only wish you had left here,
      that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to pursuits
      well worthy of you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is no pursuit more worthy of me: more worthy of the highest nature
      that exists: than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,&rsquo; said the
      young man, taking her hand. &lsquo;Rose, my own dear Rose! For years&mdash;for
      years&mdash;I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and then come
      proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to share;
      thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy moment,
      of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy&rsquo;s attachment, and claim
      your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that had been sealed
      between us! That time has not arrived; but here, with not fame won, and no
      young vision realised, I offer you the heart so long your own, and stake
      my all upon the words with which you greet the offer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.&rsquo; said Rose, mastering the
      emotions by which she was agitated. &lsquo;As you believe that I am not
      insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; replied Rose, &lsquo;that you must endeavour to forget me; not as your
      old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply; but, as
      the object of your love. Look into the world; think how many hearts you
      would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other passion to me, if
      you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most faithful friend you
      have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with one
      hand, gave free vent to her tears. Harry still retained the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your reasons, Rose,&rsquo; he said, at length, in a low voice; &lsquo;your
      reasons for this decision?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a right to know them,&rsquo; rejoined Rose. &lsquo;You can say nothing to
      alter my resolution. It is a duty that I must perform. I owe it, alike to
      others, and to myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Harry. I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless, girl,
      with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason to suspect
      that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and fastened myself, a
      clog, on all your hopes and projects. I owe it to you and yours, to
      prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your generous nature, this
      great obstacle to your progress in the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty&mdash;&rsquo; Harry began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They do not,&rsquo; replied Rose, colouring deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you return my love?&rsquo; said Harry. &lsquo;Say but that, dear Rose; say but
      that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,&rsquo; 
      rejoined Rose, &lsquo;I could have&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have received this declaration very differently?&rsquo; said Harry. &lsquo;Do not
      conceal that from me, at least, Rose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could,&rsquo; said Rose. &lsquo;Stay!&rsquo; she added, disengaging her hand, &lsquo;why should
      we prolong this painful interview? Most painful to me, and yet productive
      of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it <i>will</i> be happiness to
      know that I once held the high place in your regard which I now occupy,
      and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me with new fortitude
      and firmness. Farewell, Harry! As we have met to-day, we meet no more; but
      in other relations than those in which this conversation have placed us,
      we may be long and happily entwined; and may every blessing that the
      prayers of a true and earnest heart can call down from the source of all
      truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another word, Rose,&rsquo; said Harry. &lsquo;Your reason in your own words. From
      your own lips, let me hear it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The prospect before you,&rsquo; answered Rose, firmly, &lsquo;is a brilliant one. All
      the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can help men
      in public life, are in store for you. But those connections are proud; and
      I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the mother who gave
      me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of her who has so well
      supplied that mother&rsquo;s place. In a word,&rsquo; said the young lady, turning
      away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, &lsquo;there is a stain upon my
      name, which the world visits on innocent heads. I will carry it into no
      blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest alone on me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One word more, Rose. Dearest Rose! one more!&rsquo; cried Harry, throwing
      himself before her. &lsquo;If I had been less&mdash;less fortunate, the world
      would call it&mdash;if some obscure and peaceful life had been my destiny&mdash;if
      I had been poor, sick, helpless&mdash;would you have turned from me then?
      Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given this scruple
      birth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not press me to reply,&rsquo; answered Rose. &lsquo;The question does not arise,
      and never will. It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,&rsquo; retorted Harry, &lsquo;it
      will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the path
      before me. It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the utterance of a
      few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else. Oh, Rose: in the
      name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name of all I have
      suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer me this one
      question!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, if your lot had been differently cast,&rsquo; rejoined Rose; &lsquo;if you had
      been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been a help
      and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement, and not a
      blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I should have
      been spared this trial. I have every reason to be happy, very happy, now;
      but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded
      into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears
      with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they
      relieved her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,&rsquo; said
      Rose, extending her hand. &lsquo;I must leave you now, indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I ask one promise,&rsquo; said Harry. &lsquo;Once, and only once more,&mdash;say
      within a year, but it may be much sooner,&mdash;I may speak to you again
      on this subject, for the last time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to press me to alter my right determination,&rsquo; replied Rose, with a
      melancholy smile; &lsquo;it will be useless.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Harry; &lsquo;to hear you repeat it, if you will&mdash;finally repeat
      it! I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may possess;
      and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not seek, by word
      or act, to change it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then let it be so,&rsquo; rejoined Rose; &lsquo;it is but one pang the more, and by
      that time I may be enabled to bear it better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She extended her hand again. But the young man caught her to his bosom;
      and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from the room.

      CHAPTER XXXVI &mdash; IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT
      IMPORTANCE IN ITS PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A
      SEQUEL TO THE LAST, AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS
    </h2>
    <h3>
      TIME ARRIVES
    </h3>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning; eh?&rsquo; 
      said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the
      breakfast-table. &lsquo;Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two
      half-hours together!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will tell me a different tale one of these days,&rsquo; said Harry,
      colouring without any perceptible reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I may have good cause to do so,&rsquo; replied Mr. Losberne; &lsquo;though I
      confess I don&rsquo;t think I shall. But yesterday morning you had made up your
      mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your mother, like a
      dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce that you are going
      to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I go, on your road to
      London. And at night, you urge me, with great mystery, to start before the
      ladies are stirring; the consequence of which is, that young Oliver here
      is pinned down to his breakfast when he ought to be ranging the meadows
      after botanical phenomena of all kinds. Too bad, isn&rsquo;t it, Oliver?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and Mr.
      Maylie went away, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s a fine fellow,&rsquo; said the doctor; &lsquo;you shall come and see me when
      you return. But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication from the
      great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be gone?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The great nobs,&rsquo; replied Harry, &lsquo;under which designation, I presume, you
      include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at all, since
      I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it likely that
      anything would occur to render necessary my immediate attendance among
      them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said the doctor, &lsquo;you are a queer fellow. But of course they will
      get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and these sudden
      shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political life. There&rsquo;s
      something in that. Good training is always desirable, whether the race be
      for place, cup, or sweepstakes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue by
      one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a little; but
      he contented himself with saying, &lsquo;We shall see,&rsquo; and pursued the subject
      no farther. The post-chaise drove up to the door shortly afterwards; and
      Giles coming in for the luggage, the good doctor bustled out, to see it
      packed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oliver,&rsquo; said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, &lsquo;let me speak a word with
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him;
      much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which his
      whole behaviour displayed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can write well now?&rsquo; said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope so, sir,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would
      write to me&mdash;say once a fort-night: every alternate Monday: to the
      General Post Office in London. Will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,&rsquo; exclaimed Oliver, greatly
      delighted with the commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like to know how&mdash;how my mother and Miss Maylie are,&rsquo; said
      the young man; &lsquo;and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks you
      take, and what you talk about, and whether she&mdash;they, I mean&mdash;seem
      happy and quite well. You understand me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! quite, sir, quite,&rsquo; replied Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would rather you did not mention it to them,&rsquo; said Harry, hurrying over
      his words; &lsquo;because it might make my mother anxious to write to me
      oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret between
      you and me; and mind you tell me everything! I depend upon you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance, faithfully
      promised to be secret and explicit in his communications. Mr. Maylie took
      leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and protection.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should be
      left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants were
      in the garden, looking on. Harry cast one slight glance at the latticed
      window, and jumped into the carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drive on!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;hard, fast, full gallop! Nothing short of flying
      will keep pace with me, to-day.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Halloa!&rsquo; cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great hurry,
      and shouting to the postillion; &lsquo;something very short of flying will keep
      pace with <i>me</i>. Do you hear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible, and
      its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound its way
      along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly disappearing,
      and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects, or the intricacies
      of the way, permitted. It was not until even the dusty cloud was no longer
      to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot
      where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away;
      for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when Harry
      raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He seems in high spirits and happy,&rsquo; she said, at length. &lsquo;I feared for a
      time he might be otherwise. I was mistaken. I am very, very glad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed down
      Rose&rsquo;s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in the same
      direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVII &mdash; IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT
      UNCOMMON IN MATRIMONIAL CASES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on
      the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam
      proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which
      were sent back from its cold and shining surface. A paper fly-cage dangled
      from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in gloomy
      thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy net-work,
      Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy shadow overspread
      his countenance. Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might be that the insects
      brought to mind, some painful passage in his own past life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor was Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a pleasing
      melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting other
      appearances, and those closely connected with his own person, which
      announced that a great change had taken place in the position of his
      affairs. The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they? He still
      wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether limbs; but
      they were not <i>the</i> breeches. The coat was wide-skirted; and in that
      respect like <i>the</i> coat, but, oh how different! The mighty cocked hat
      was replaced by a modest round one. Mr. Bumble was no longer a beadle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more
      substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from
      the coats and waistcoats connected with them. A field-marshal has his
      uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle his
      cocked hat. Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his hat and
      lace; what are they? Men. Mere men. Dignity, and even holiness too,
      sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than some people
      imagine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.
      Another beadle had come into power. On him the cocked hat, gold-laced
      coat, and staff, had all three descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And to-morrow two months it was done!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh. &lsquo;It
      seems a age.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence of
      happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh&mdash;there
      was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I sold myself,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection,
      &lsquo;for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small
      quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money. I went very
      reasonable. Cheap, dirt cheap!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cheap!&rsquo; cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s ear: &lsquo;you would have been
      dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort,
      who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his
      complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Bumble, ma&rsquo;am!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; cried the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have the goodness to look at me,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes upon
      her. (If she stands such a eye as that,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble to himself, &lsquo;she
      can stand anything. It is a eye I never knew to fail with paupers. If it
      fails with her, my power is gone.&rsquo;)
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell
      paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or whether
      the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle glances; are
      matters of opinion. The matter of fact, is, that the matron was in no way
      overpowered by Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s scowl, but, on the contrary, treated it with
      great disdain, and even raised a laugh thereat, which sounded as though it
      were genuine.
    </p>
    <p>
      On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first
      incredulous, and afterwards amazed. He then relapsed into his former
      state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened by
      the voice of his partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?&rsquo; inquired Mrs. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; rejoined Mr.
      Bumble; &lsquo;and although I was <i>not</i> snoring, I shall snore, gape,
      sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my
      prerogative.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Your</i> prerogative!&rsquo; sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I said the word, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;The prerogative of a man is to
      command.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what&rsquo;s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?&rsquo; cried
      the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To obey, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; thundered Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;Your late unfortunate husband
      should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive
      now. I wish he was, poor man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now arrived,
      and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or other, must
      necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this allusion to the
      dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with a loud scream that
      Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a paroxysm of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s soul; his
      heart was waterproof. Like washable beaver hats that improve with rain,
      his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of tears,
      which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of his own
      power, pleased and exalted him. He eyed his good lady with looks of great
      satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that she should cry
      her hardest: the exercise being looked upon, by the faculty, as strongly
      conducive to health.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and
      softens down the temper,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;So cry away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat from
      a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man might,
      who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner, thrust his
      hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with much ease and
      waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less
      troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make
      trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in
      discovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow
      sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the
      opposite end of the room. This preliminary proceeding laying bare his
      head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one
      hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and
      dexterity) upon it with the other. This done, she created a little variety
      by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by this time,
      inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the offence, she
      pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated for the purpose:
      and defied him to talk about his prerogative again, if he dared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get up!&rsquo; said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command. &lsquo;And take yourself away
      from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance: wondering much what
      something desperate might be. Picking up his hat, he looked towards the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you going?&rsquo; demanded Mrs. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly, my dear, certainly,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker
      motion towards the door. &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t intend to&mdash;I&rsquo;m going, my dear! You
      are so very violent, that really I&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the
      carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle. Mr. Bumble immediately
      darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought on his
      unfinished sentence: leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full possession of
      the field.

      Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten. He had a
      decided propensity for bullying: derived no inconsiderable pleasure from
      the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is needless to
      say) a coward. This is by no means a disparagement to his character; for
      many official personages, who are held in high respect and admiration, are
      the victims of similar infirmities. The remark is made, indeed, rather in
      his favour than otherwise, and with a view of impressing the reader with a
      just sense of his qualifications for office.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full. After making a tour
      of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws really
      were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their wives,
      leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be visited
      with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious individuals
      who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some of the female
      paupers were usually employed in washing the parish linen: when the sound
      of voices in conversation, now proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. &lsquo;These women
      at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo there!
      What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very
      fierce and angry manner: which was at once exchanged for a most humiliated
      and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the form of his lady
      wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you were here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Didn&rsquo;t know I was here!&rsquo; repeated Mrs. Bumble. &lsquo;What do <i>you</i> do
      here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work
      properly, my dear,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble: glancing distractedly at a couple
      of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of admiration at
      the workhouse-master&rsquo;s humility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>You</i> thought they were talking too much?&rsquo; said Mrs. Bumble. &lsquo;What
      business is it of yours?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, my dear&mdash;&rsquo; urged Mr. Bumble submissively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What business is it of yours?&rsquo; demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s very true, you&rsquo;re matron here, my dear,&rsquo; submitted Mr. Bumble; &lsquo;but
      I thought you mightn&rsquo;t be in the way just then.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,&rsquo; returned his lady. &lsquo;We don&rsquo;t want any of
      your interference. You&rsquo;re a great deal too fond of poking your nose into
      things that don&rsquo;t concern you, making everybody in the house laugh, the
      moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a fool every
      hour in the day. Be off; come!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two old
      paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated for an
      instant. Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught up a bowl of
      soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him instantly to
      depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly person.
    </p>
    <p>
      What could Mr. Bumble do? He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away; and,
      as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a shrill
      chuckle of irrepressible delight. It wanted but this. He was degraded in
      their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very paupers; he had
      fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to the lowest depth of
      the most snubbed hen-peckery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All in two months!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts. &lsquo;Two
      months! No more than two months ago, I was not only my own master, but
      everybody else&rsquo;s, so far as the porochial workhouse was concerned, and
      now!&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was too much. Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the gate
      for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and walked,
      distractedly, into the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated the
      first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made him
      thirsty. He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length paused
      before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a hasty peep
      over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary customer. It began to
      rain, heavily, at the moment. This determined him. Mr. Bumble stepped in;
      and ordering something to drink, as he passed the bar, entered the
      apartment into which he had looked from the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large cloak.
      He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain haggardness in his
      look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to have travelled some
      distance. He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered, but scarcely deigned to
      nod his head in acknowledgment of his salutation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the
      stranger had been more familiar: so he drank his gin-and-water in silence,
      and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.
    </p>
    <p>
      It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall into
      company under such circumstances: that Mr. Bumble felt, every now and
      then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a look at
      the stranger: and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his eyes, in some
      confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment stealing a look at
      him. Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s awkwardness was enhanced by the very remarkable
      expression of the stranger&rsquo;s eye, which was keen and bright, but shadowed
      by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike anything he had ever observed
      before, and repulsive to behold.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had encountered each other&rsquo;s glance several times in this way,
      the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Were you looking for me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;when you peered in at the window?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not that I am aware of, unless you&rsquo;re Mr.&mdash;&rsquo; Here Mr. Bumble stopped
      short; for he was curious to know the stranger&rsquo;s name, and thought in his
      impatience, he might supply the blank.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see you were not,&rsquo; said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm
      playing about his mouth; &lsquo;or you have known my name. You don&rsquo;t know it. I
      would recommend you not to ask for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I meant no harm, young man,&rsquo; observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And have done none,&rsquo; said the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Another silence succeeded this short dialogue: which was again broken by
      the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen you before, I think?&rsquo; said he. &lsquo;You were differently dressed
      at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should know you
      again. You were beadle here, once; were you not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; &lsquo;porochial beadle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just so,&rsquo; rejoined the other, nodding his head. &lsquo;It was in that character
      I saw you. What are you now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Master of the workhouse,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and impressively,
      to check any undue familiarity the stranger might otherwise assume.
      &lsquo;Master of the workhouse, young man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I doubt
      not?&rsquo; resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s eyes, as he
      raised them in astonishment at the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t scruple to answer freely, man. I know you pretty well, you see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I suppose, a married man,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with his
      hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident
      perplexity, &lsquo;is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can,
      than a single one. Porochial officers are not so well paid that they can
      afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a civil
      and proper manner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had not
      mistaken his man; then rang the bell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fill this glass again,&rsquo; he said, handing Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s empty tumbler to
      the landlord. &lsquo;Let it be strong and hot. You like it so, I suppose?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not too strong,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You understand what that means, landlord!&rsquo; said the stranger, drily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a
      steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr.
      Bumble&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now listen to me,&rsquo; said the stranger, after closing the door and window.
      &lsquo;I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by one of those
      chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends sometimes, you
      walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you were uppermost in my
      mind. I want some information from you. I don&rsquo;t ask you to give it for
      nothing, slight as it is. Put up that, to begin with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his
      companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money
      should be heard without. When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the
      coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much
      satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Carry your memory back&mdash;let me see&mdash;twelve years, last winter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a long time,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;Very good. I&rsquo;ve done it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The scene, the workhouse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the time, night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable drabs
      brought forth the life and health so often denied to themselves&mdash;gave
      birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and hid their shame, rot
      &lsquo;em in the grave!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The lying-in room, I suppose?&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, not quite following the
      stranger&rsquo;s excited description.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the stranger. &lsquo;A boy was born there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A many boys,&rsquo; observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A murrain on the young devils!&rsquo; cried the stranger; &lsquo;I speak of one; a
      meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a
      coffin-maker&mdash;I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in
      it&mdash;and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you mean Oliver! Young Twist!&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble; &lsquo;I remember him, of
      course. There wasn&rsquo;t a obstinater young rascal&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not of him I want to hear; I&rsquo;ve heard enough of him,&rsquo; said the
      stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject of
      poor Oliver&rsquo;s vices. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s of a woman; the hag that nursed his mother.
      Where is she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is she?&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered
      facetious. &lsquo;It would be hard to tell. There&rsquo;s no midwifery there,
      whichever place she&rsquo;s gone to; so I suppose she&rsquo;s out of employment,
      anyway.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; demanded the stranger, sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That she died last winter,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and
      although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his gaze
      gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in thought. For
      some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be relieved or
      disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed more freely;
      and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great matter. With that
      he rose, as if to depart.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an opportunity
      was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in the possession of
      his better half. He well remembered the night of old Sally&rsquo;s death, which
      the occurrences of that day had given him good reason to recollect, as the
      occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs. Corney; and although that lady
      had never confided to him the disclosure of which she had been the
      solitary witness, he had heard enough to know that it related to something
      that had occurred in the old woman&rsquo;s attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon
      the young mother of Oliver Twist. Hastily calling this circumstance to
      mind, he informed the stranger, with an air of mystery, that one woman had
      been closeted with the old harridan shortly before she died; and that she
      could, as he had reason to believe, throw some light on the subject of his
      inquiry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How can I find her?&rsquo; said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and plainly
      showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused afresh by the
      intelligence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only through me,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When?&rsquo; cried the stranger, hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow,&rsquo; rejoined Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At nine in the evening,&rsquo; said the stranger, producing a scrap of paper,
      and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side, in
      characters that betrayed his agitation; &lsquo;at nine in the evening, bring her
      to me there. I needn&rsquo;t tell you to be secret. It&rsquo;s your interest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for
      the liquor that had been drunk. Shortly remarking that their roads were
      different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic repetition
      of the hour of appointment for the following night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it
      contained no name. The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him to
      ask it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you want?&rsquo; cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble
      touched him on the arm. &lsquo;Following me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to ask a question,&rsquo; said the other, pointing to the scrap of paper.
      &lsquo;What name am I to ask for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monks!&rsquo; rejoined the man; and strode hastily, away.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXXVIII &mdash; CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR.
      AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening. The clouds, which had been
      threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of vapour,
      already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a violent
      thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the main street of
      the town, directed their course towards a scattered little colony of
      ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half, or thereabouts, and
      erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon the river.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might,
      perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the
      rain, and sheltering them from observation. The husband carried a lantern,
      from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few paces in
      front, as though&mdash;the way being dirty&mdash;to give his wife the
      benefit of treading in his heavy footprints. They went on, in profound
      silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned his
      head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then, discovering
      that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of walking, and
      proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards their place of
      destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long
      been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under various
      pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on plunder and
      crime. It was a collection of mere hovels: some, hastily built with loose
      bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled together without
      any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for the most part,
      within a few feet of the river&rsquo;s bank. A few leaky boats drawn up on the
      mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which skirted it: and here and there
      an oar or coil of rope: appeared, at first, to indicate that the
      inhabitants of these miserable cottages pursued some avocation on the
      river; but a glance at the shattered and useless condition of the articles
      thus displayed, would have led a passer-by, without much difficulty, to
      the conjecture that they were disposed there, rather for the preservation
      of appearances, than with any view to their being actually employed.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its
      upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a
      manufactory of some kind. It had, in its day, probably furnished
      employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements. But it had
      long since gone to ruin. The rat, the worm, and the action of the damp,
      had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a considerable
      portion of the building had already sunk down into the water; while the
      remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream, seemed to wait a
      favourable opportunity of following its old companion, and involving
      itself in the same fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as the
      first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain
      commenced pouring violently down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The place should be somewhere here,&rsquo; said Bumble, consulting a scrap of
      paper he held in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Halloa there!&rsquo; cried a voice from above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man looking
      out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stand still, a minute,&rsquo; cried the voice; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll be with you directly.&rsquo; 
      With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that the man?&rsquo; asked Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s good lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then, mind what I told you,&rsquo; said the matron: &lsquo;and be careful to say as
      little as you can, or you&rsquo;ll betray us at once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was
      apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of
      proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was
      prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near which
      they stood, and beckoned them inwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come in!&rsquo; he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      keep me here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any other
      invitation. Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind, followed:
      obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that remarkable
      dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?&rsquo; said Monks,
      turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the door behind
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&mdash;we were only cooling ourselves,&rsquo; stammered Bumble, looking
      apprehensively about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cooling yourselves!&rsquo; retorted Monks. &lsquo;Not all the rain that ever fell, or
      ever will fall, will put as much of hell&rsquo;s fire out, as a man can carry
      about with him. You won&rsquo;t cool yourself so easily; don&rsquo;t think it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and bent
      his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was fain to
      withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the woman, is it?&rsquo; demanded Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hem! That is the woman,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife&rsquo;s
      caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?&rsquo; said the matron,
      interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know they will always keep <i>one</i> till it&rsquo;s found out,&rsquo; said Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what may that be?&rsquo; asked the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The loss of their own good name,&rsquo; replied Monks. &lsquo;So, by the same rule,
      if a woman&rsquo;s a party to a secret that might hang or transport her, I&rsquo;m not
      afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I! Do you understand, mistress?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course you don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; said Monks. &lsquo;How should you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two
      companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened
      across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the
      roof. He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder,
      leading to another floor of warehouses above: when a bright flash of
      lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed,
      which shook the crazy building to its centre.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear it!&rsquo; he cried, shrinking back. &lsquo;Hear it! Rolling and crashing on as
      if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were hiding from
      it. I hate the sound!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands
      suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr.
      Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These fits come over me, now and then,&rsquo; said Monks, observing his alarm;
      &lsquo;and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don&rsquo;t mind me now; it&rsquo;s all over
      for this once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the
      window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which hung
      at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy beams in
      the ceiling: and which cast a dim light upon an old table and three chairs
      that were placed beneath it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, &lsquo;the sooner
      we come to our business, the better for all. The woman know what it is,
      does she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the reply,
      by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died; and
      that she told you something&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About the mother of the boy you named,&rsquo; replied the matron interrupting
      him. &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first question is, of what nature was her communication?&rsquo; said Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the second,&rsquo; observed the woman with much deliberation. &lsquo;The first
      is, what may the communication be worth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?&rsquo; asked
      Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,&rsquo; answered Mrs. Bumble: who did
      not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Humph!&rsquo; said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry;
      &lsquo;there may be money&rsquo;s worth to get, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps there may,&rsquo; was the composed reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Something that was taken from her,&rsquo; said Monks. &lsquo;Something that she wore.
      Something that&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better bid,&rsquo; interrupted Mrs. Bumble. &lsquo;I have heard enough,
      already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any
      greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened to
      this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes: which he directed
      towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised astonishment;
      increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded, what sum was
      required for the disclosure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s it worth to you?&rsquo; asked the woman, as collectedly as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,&rsquo; replied Monks. &lsquo;Speak out,
      and let me know which.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty pounds
      in gold,&rsquo; said the woman; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll tell you all I know. Not before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five-and-twenty pounds!&rsquo; exclaimed Monks, drawing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I spoke as plainly as I could,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bumble. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a large
      sum, either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it&rsquo;s told!&rsquo; 
      cried Monks impatiently; &lsquo;and which has been lying dead for twelve years
      past or more!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value in
      course of time,&rsquo; answered the matron, still preserving the resolute
      indifference she had assumed. &lsquo;As to lying dead, there are those who will
      lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for
      anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if I pay it for nothing?&rsquo; asked Monks, hesitating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can easily take it away again,&rsquo; replied the matron. &lsquo;I am but a
      woman; alone here; and unprotected.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,&rsquo; submitted Mr. Bumble, in a
      voice tremulous with fear: &lsquo;<i>I</i> am here, my dear. And besides,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, &lsquo;Mr. Monks is too much of a
      gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons. Mr. Monks is aware
      that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a little run to
      seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd: I say I have no doubt Mr. Monks has
      heerd, my dear: that I am a very determined officer, with very uncommon
      strength, if I&rsquo;m once roused. I only want a little rousing; that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern
      with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed expression
      of every feature, that he <i>did</i> want a little rousing, and not a
      little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless, indeed,
      against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for the purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are a fool,&rsquo; said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; &lsquo;and had better hold your
      tongue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can&rsquo;t speak in a
      lower tone,&rsquo; said Monks, grimly. &lsquo;So! He&rsquo;s your husband, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He my husband!&rsquo; tittered the matron, parrying the question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought as much, when you came in,&rsquo; rejoined Monks, marking the angry
      glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke. &lsquo;So much the
      better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people, when I find
      that there&rsquo;s only one will between them. I&rsquo;m in earnest. See here!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told
      out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the
      woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder,
      which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let&rsquo;s hear
      your story.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break
      almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from the
      table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say. The faces of
      the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small table in
      their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to render her
      whisper audible. The sickly rays of the suspended lantern falling directly
      upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of their countenances:
      which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness, looked ghastly in the
      extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,&rsquo; the matron began, &lsquo;she
      and I were alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was there no one by?&rsquo; asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; &lsquo;No sick
      wretch or idiot in some other bed? No one who could hear, and might, by
      possibility, understand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a soul,&rsquo; replied the woman; &lsquo;we were alone. <i>I</i> stood alone
      beside the body when death came over it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said Monks, regarding her attentively. &lsquo;Go on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She spoke of a young creature,&rsquo; resumed the matron, &lsquo;who had brought a
      child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room, but
      in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay?&rsquo; said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder,
      &lsquo;Blood! How things come about!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The child was the one you named to him last night,&rsquo; said the matron,
      nodding carelessly towards her husband; &lsquo;the mother this nurse had
      robbed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In life?&rsquo; asked Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In death,&rsquo; replied the woman, with something like a shudder. &lsquo;She stole
      from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the dead
      mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the infant&rsquo;s
      sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She sold it,&rsquo; cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; &lsquo;did she sell it?
      Where? When? To whom? How long before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,&rsquo; said the
      matron, &lsquo;she fell back and died.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Without saying more?&rsquo; cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very
      suppression, seemed only the more furious. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a lie! I&rsquo;ll not be played
      with. She said more. I&rsquo;ll tear the life out of you both, but I&rsquo;ll know
      what it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She didn&rsquo;t utter another word,&rsquo; said the woman, to all appearance unmoved
      (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man&rsquo;s violence;
      &lsquo;but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which was partly
      closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the hand by
      force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which contained&mdash;&rsquo; interposed Monks, stretching forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied the woman; &lsquo;it was a pawnbroker&rsquo;s duplicate.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For what?&rsquo; demanded Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In good time I&rsquo;ll tell you.&rsquo; said the woman. &lsquo;I judge that she had kept
      the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better account;
      and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together money to pay the
      pawnbroker&rsquo;s interest year by year, and prevent its running out; so that
      if anything came of it, it could still be redeemed. Nothing had come of
      it; and, as I tell you, she died with the scrap of paper, all worn and
      tattered, in her hand. The time was out in two days; I thought something
      might one day come of it too; and so redeemed the pledge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is it now?&rsquo; asked Monks quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>There</i>,&rsquo; replied the woman. And, as if glad to be relieved of it,
      she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough for
      a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling hands.
      It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of hair, and a
      plain gold wedding-ring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It has the word &ldquo;Agnes&rdquo; engraved on the inside,&rsquo; said the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date; which
      is within a year before the child was born. I found out that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And this is all?&rsquo; said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the
      contents of the little packet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All,&rsquo; replied the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the story
      was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty pounds back
      again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration which had been
      trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of the previous
      dialogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,&rsquo; said his wife
      addressing Monks, after a short silence; &lsquo;and I want to know nothing; for
      it&rsquo;s safer not. But I may ask you two questions, may I?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may ask,&rsquo; said Monks, with some show of surprise; &lsquo;but whether I
      answer or not is another question.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;Which makes three,&rsquo; observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of
      facetiousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that what you expected to get from me?&rsquo; demanded the matron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; replied Monks. &lsquo;The other question?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you propose to do with it? Can it be used against me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; rejoined Monks; &lsquo;nor against me either. See here! But don&rsquo;t move
      a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an iron
      ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened close at
      Mr. Bumble&rsquo;s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several paces
      backward, with great precipitation.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0175.jpg" alt="0175" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0175.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Look down,&rsquo; said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t fear
      me. I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were seated over
      it, if that had been my game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble
      himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid
      water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all
      other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against
      the green and slimy piles. There had once been a water-mill beneath; the
      tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments of
      machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new impulse,
      when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted to stem its
      headlong course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you flung a man&rsquo;s body down there, where would it be to-morrow
      morning?&rsquo; said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,&rsquo; replied Bumble,
      recoiling at the thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly
      thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of
      some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream. It
      fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely audible
      splash; and was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three looking into each other&rsquo;s faces, seemed to breathe more freely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back into
      its former position. &lsquo;If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books say it
      will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash among it.
      We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant party.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By all means,&rsquo; observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?&rsquo; said Monks, with a
      threatening look. &lsquo;I am not afraid of your wife.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may depend upon me, young man,&rsquo; answered Mr. Bumble, bowing himself
      gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. &lsquo;On everybody&rsquo;s
      account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,&rsquo; remarked Monks. &lsquo;Light your
      lantern! And get away from here as fast as you can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr.
      Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would
      infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below. He lighted his
      lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now carried
      in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse, descended in
      silence, followed by his wife. Monks brought up the rear, after pausing on
      the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other sounds to be heard
      than the beating of the rain without, and the rushing of the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks started
      at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot above the
      ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a marvellously
      light step for a gentleman of his figure: looking nervously about him for
      hidden trap-doors. The gate at which they had entered, was softly
      unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a nod with their
      mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into the wet and
      darkness outside.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an
      invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been
      hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he
      returned to the chamber he had just quitted.

      CHAPTER XXXIX &mdash; INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE
      READER IS ALREADY ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR
      WORTHY HEADS TOGETHER
    </h2>
    <p>
      On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned in
      the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as therein
      narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily growled forth
      an inquiry what time of night it was.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of those
      he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it was in
      the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great distance from
      his former lodgings. It was not, in appearance, so desirable a habitation
      as his old quarters: being a mean and badly-furnished apartment, of very
      limited size; lighted only by one small window in the shelving roof, and
      abutting on a close and dirty lane. Nor were there wanting other
      indications of the good gentleman&rsquo;s having gone down in the world of late:
      for a great scarcity of furniture, and total absence of comfort, together
      with the disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and
      linen, bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated
      condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these symptoms,
      if they had stood in any need of corroboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat, by
      way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree
      improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled
      nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week&rsquo;s growth. The dog sat at the
      bedside: now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now pricking his
      ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the street, or in the
      lower part of the house, attracted his attention. Seated by the window,
      busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which formed a portion of the
      robber&rsquo;s ordinary dress, was a female: so pale and reduced with watching
      and privation, that there would have been considerable difficulty in
      recognising her as the same Nancy who has already figured in this tale,
      but for the voice in which she replied to Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not long gone seven,&rsquo; said the girl. &lsquo;How do you feel to-night, Bill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As weak as water,&rsquo; replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes and
      limbs. &lsquo;Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering bed
      anyhow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes&rsquo;s temper; for, as the girl raised him
      up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her awkwardness,
      and struck her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whining are you?&rsquo; said Sikes. &lsquo;Come! Don&rsquo;t stand snivelling there. If you
      can&rsquo;t do anything better than that, cut off altogether. D&rsquo;ye hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hear you,&rsquo; replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a
      laugh. &lsquo;What fancy have you got in your head now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you&rsquo;ve thought better of it, have you?&rsquo; growled Sikes, marking the
      tear which trembled in her eye. &lsquo;All the better for you, you have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you don&rsquo;t mean to say, you&rsquo;d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,&rsquo; said
      the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; cried Mr. Sikes. &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such a number of nights,&rsquo; said the girl, with a touch of woman&rsquo;s
      tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even to
      her voice: &lsquo;such a number of nights as I&rsquo;ve been patient with you, nursing
      and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the first that
      I&rsquo;ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn&rsquo;t have served me as you did just
      now, if you&rsquo;d thought of that, would you? Come, come; say you wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, then,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Sikes, &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t. Why, damme, now, the
      girls&rsquo;s whining again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s nothing,&rsquo; said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you
      seem to mind me. It&rsquo;ll soon be over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;ll be over?&rsquo; demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. &lsquo;What foolery are
      you up to, now, again? Get up and bustle about, and don&rsquo;t come over me
      with your woman&rsquo;s nonsense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was
      delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really
      weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and
      fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths
      with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his
      threats. Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon emergency;
      for Miss Nancy&rsquo;s hysterics were usually of that violent kind which the
      patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance; Mr. Sikes
      tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment wholly
      ineffectual, called for assistance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter here, my dear?&rsquo; said Fagin, looking in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lend a hand to the girl, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; replied Sikes impatiently. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t
      stand chattering and grinning at me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl&rsquo;s assistance,
      while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who had followed his
      venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on the floor a bundle
      with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from the grasp of Master
      Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked it in a twinkling with
      his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents down the patient&rsquo;s throat:
      previously taking a taste, himself, to prevent mistakes.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0183.jpg" alt="0183" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0183.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Dawkins; &lsquo;and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the petticuts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially that
      department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his share
      in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry: were not long in
      producing the desired effect. The girl gradually recovered her senses;
      and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon the pillow:
      leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some astonishment at
      their unlooked-for appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?&rsquo; he asked Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and
      I&rsquo;ve brought something good with me, that you&rsquo;ll be glad to see. Dodger,
      my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that we spent
      all our money on, this morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In compliance with Mr. Fagin&rsquo;s request, the Artful untied this bundle,
      which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed the
      articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed them on
      the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and excellence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,&rsquo; exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing to
      view a huge pasty; &lsquo;sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender limbs,
      Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there&rsquo;s no occasion to
      pick &lsquo;em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so precious strong
      that if you mix it with biling water, it&rsquo;ll go nigh to blow the lid of the
      tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that the niggers didn&rsquo;t
      work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a pitch of goodness,&mdash;oh
      no! Two half-quartern brans; pound of best fresh; piece of double
      Glo&rsquo;ster; and, to wind up all, some of the richest sort you ever lushed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his
      extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while Mr.
      Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw spirits
      from the bottle he carried: which the invalid tossed down his throat
      without a moment&rsquo;s hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll do,
      Bill; you&rsquo;ll do now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Sikes; &lsquo;I might have been done for, twenty times over,
      afore you&rsquo;d have done anything to help me. What do you mean by leaving a
      man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted wagabond?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only hear him, boys!&rsquo; said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. &lsquo;And us come
      to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The things is well enough in their way,&rsquo; observed Mr. Sikes: a little
      soothed as he glanced over the table; &lsquo;but what have you got to say for
      yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health, blunt,
      and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this mortal time,
      than if I was that &lsquo;ere dog.&mdash;Drive him down, Charley!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never see such a jolly dog as that,&rsquo; cried Master Bates, doing as he
      was desired. &lsquo;Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market! He&rsquo;d
      make his fortun&rsquo; on the stage that dog would, and rewive the drama
      besides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your din,&rsquo; cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still
      growling angrily. &lsquo;What have you got to say for yourself, you withered old
      fence, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,&rsquo; replied
      the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what about the other fortnight?&rsquo; demanded Sikes. &lsquo;What about the
      other fortnight that you&rsquo;ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his
      hole?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t help it, Bill. I can&rsquo;t go into a long explanation before
      company; but I couldn&rsquo;t help it, upon my honour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon your what?&rsquo; growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. &lsquo;Here! Cut me off
      a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out of my
      mouth, or it&rsquo;ll choke me dead.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be out of temper, my dear,&rsquo; urged Fagin, submissively. &lsquo;I have
      never forgot you, Bill; never once.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No! I&rsquo;ll pound it that you han&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid
      shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do
      that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well: and
      was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for the girl, I
      might have died.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There now, Bill,&rsquo; remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word. &lsquo;If
      it hadn&rsquo;t been for the girl! Who but poor ould Fagin was the means of your
      having such a handy girl about you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He says true enough there!&rsquo; said Nancy, coming hastily forward. &lsquo;Let him
      be; let him be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy&rsquo;s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,
      receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with liquor:
      of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin, assuming an
      unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a better temper,
      by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant banter; and,
      moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough jokes, which,
      after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he condescended to make.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all very well,&rsquo; said Mr. Sikes; &lsquo;but I must have some blunt from you
      to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t a piece of coin about me,&rsquo; replied the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&rsquo;ve got lots at home,&rsquo; retorted Sikes; &lsquo;and I must have some from
      there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lots!&rsquo; cried Fagin, holding up is hands. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t so much as would&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know how much you&rsquo;ve got, and I dare say you hardly know
      yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,&rsquo; said Sikes;
      &lsquo;but I must have some to-night; and that&rsquo;s flat.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, well,&rsquo; said Fagin, with a sigh, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll send the Artful round
      presently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t do nothing of the kind,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Sikes. &lsquo;The Artful&rsquo;s a
      deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get dodged
      by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you put him up
      to it. Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all sure; and I&rsquo;ll
      lie down and have a snooze while she&rsquo;s gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the amount
      of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four and
      sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would only
      leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly remarking
      that if he couldn&rsquo;t get any more he must accompany him home; with the
      Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard. The Jew then,
      taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward, attended by
      Nancy and the boys: Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself on the bed, and
      composing himself to sleep away the time until the young lady&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due course, they arrived at Fagin&rsquo;s abode, where they found Toby
      Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage,
      which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and with
      it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his young
      friends. Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found relaxing
      himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and mental
      endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has nobody been, Toby?&rsquo; asked Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a living leg,&rsquo; answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s
      been as dull as swipes. You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin, to
      recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I&rsquo;m as flat as a juryman;
      and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn&rsquo;t had the
      good natur&rsquo; to amuse this youngster. Horrid dull, I&rsquo;m blessed if I an&rsquo;t!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit swept
      up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with a haughty
      air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly beneath the
      consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he swaggered out of the
      room, with so much elegance and gentility, that Mr. Chitling, bestowing
      numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots till they were out of
      sight, assured the company that he considered his acquaintance cheap at
      fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he didn&rsquo;t value his losses the
      snap of his little finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!&rsquo; said Master Bates, highly amused by this
      declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a bit of it,&rsquo; replied Mr. Chitling. &lsquo;Am I, Fagin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A very clever fellow, my dear,&rsquo; said Fagin, patting him on the shoulder,
      and winking to his other pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an&rsquo;t he, Fagin?&rsquo; asked Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No doubt at all of that, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an&rsquo;t it, Fagin?&rsquo; 
      pursued Tom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very much so, indeed, my dear. They&rsquo;re only jealous, Tom, because he
      won&rsquo;t give it to them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; cried Tom, triumphantly, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s where it is! He has cleaned me out.
      But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can&rsquo;t I, Fagin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up
      your loss at once, and don&rsquo;t lose any more time. Dodger! Charley! It&rsquo;s
      time you were on the lay. Come! It&rsquo;s near ten, and nothing done yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their hats,
      and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging, as they
      went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in whose conduct,
      it is but justice to say, there was nothing very conspicuous or peculiar:
      inasmuch as there are a great number of spirited young bloods upon town,
      who pay a much higher price than Mr. Chitling for being seen in good
      society: and a great number of fine gentlemen (composing the good society
      aforesaid) who established their reputation upon very much the same
      footing as flash Toby Crackit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said Fagin, when they had left the room, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and get you that
      cash, Nancy. This is only the key of a little cupboard where I keep a few
      odd things the boys get, my dear. I never lock up my money, for I&rsquo;ve got
      none to lock up, my dear&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&mdash;none to lock up. It&rsquo;s a
      poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I&rsquo;m fond of seeing the young people
      about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all. Hush!&rsquo; he said, hastily
      concealing the key in his breast; &lsquo;who&rsquo;s that? Listen!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared in
      no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person, whoever
      he was, came or went: until the murmur of a man&rsquo;s voice reached her ears.
      The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her bonnet and shawl, with
      the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under the table. The Jew,
      turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered a complaint of the
      heat: in a tone of languor that contrasted, very remarkably, with the
      extreme haste and violence of this action: which, however, had been
      unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s the man
      I expected before; he&rsquo;s coming downstairs. Not a word about the money
      while he&rsquo;s here, Nance. He won&rsquo;t stop long. Not ten minutes, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to the
      door, as a man&rsquo;s step was heard upon the stairs without. He reached it, at
      the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into the room, was
      close upon the girl before he observed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only one of my young people,&rsquo; said Fagin, observing that Monks drew back,
      on beholding a stranger. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t move, Nancy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of
      careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she
      stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if
      there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly have
      believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Any news?&rsquo; inquired Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And&mdash;and&mdash;good?&rsquo; asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to
      vex the other man by being too sanguine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not bad, any way,&rsquo; replied Monks with a smile. &lsquo;I have been prompt enough
      this time. Let me have a word with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room,
      although she could see that Monks was pointing to her. The Jew: perhaps
      fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he endeavoured
      to get rid of her: pointed upward, and took Monks out of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not that infernal hole we were in before,&rsquo; she could hear the man say as
      they went upstairs. Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did not
      reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his companion to
      the second story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the house,
      the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely over her
      head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door, listening with
      breathless interest. The moment the noise ceased, she glided from the
      room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and silence; and was
      lost in the gloom above.
    </p>
    <p>
      The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl
      glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards,
      the two men were heard descending. Monks went at once into the street; and
      the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money. When he returned, the girl
      was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, Nance!&rsquo; exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the candle,
      &lsquo;how pale you are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pale!&rsquo; echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look
      steadily at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite horrible. What have you been doing to yourself?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don&rsquo;t
      know how long and all,&rsquo; replied the girl carelessly. &lsquo;Come! Let me get
      back; that&rsquo;s a dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her hand.
      They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a
      &lsquo;good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep; and
      seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue her way.
      Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite opposite to that
      in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened her pace, until it
      gradually resolved into a violent run. After completely exhausting
      herself, she stopped to take breath: and, as if suddenly recollecting
      herself, and deploring her inability to do something she was bent upon,
      wrung her hands, and burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full
      hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with
      nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover lost
      time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own
      thoughts: soon reached the dwelling where she had left the housebreaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes, he
      did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the money, and
      receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of satisfaction,
      and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the slumbers which her
      arrival had interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so
      much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal had
      so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his temper;
      that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical upon her
      behaviour and deportment. That she had all the abstracted and nervous
      manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous step, which it
      has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would have been obvious
      to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have taken the alarm at
      once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of discrimination, and being
      troubled with no more subtle misgivings than those which resolve
      themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour towards everybody; and
      being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable condition, as has been already
      observed; saw nothing unusual in her demeanor, and indeed, troubled
      himself so little about her, that, had her agitation been far more
      perceptible than it was, it would have been very unlikely to have awakened
      his suspicions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As that day closed in, the girl&rsquo;s excitement increased; and, when night
      came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink
      himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire in
      her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water
      with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass
      towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when these
      symptoms first struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, burn my body!&rsquo; said the man, raising himself on his hands as he
      stared the girl in the face. &lsquo;You look like a corpse come to life again.
      What&rsquo;s the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Matter!&rsquo; replied the girl. &lsquo;Nothing. What do you look at me so hard for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What foolery is this?&rsquo; demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and
      shaking her roughly. &lsquo;What is it? What do you mean? What are you thinking
      of?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of many things, Bill,&rsquo; replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so,
      pressing her hands upon her eyes. &lsquo;But, Lord! What odds in that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed to
      produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look which
      had preceded them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I tell you wot it is,&rsquo; said Sikes; &lsquo;if you haven&rsquo;t caught the fever, and
      got it comin&rsquo; on, now, there&rsquo;s something more than usual in the wind, and
      something dangerous too. You&rsquo;re not a-going to&mdash;. No, damme! you
      wouldn&rsquo;t do that!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do what?&rsquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There ain&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the
      words to himself; &lsquo;there ain&rsquo;t a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I&rsquo;d have
      cut her throat three months ago. She&rsquo;s got the fever coming on; that&rsquo;s
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the
      bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic. The
      girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but with her
      back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he drank off the
      contents.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; said the robber, &lsquo;come and sit aside of me, and put on your own
      face; or I&rsquo;ll alter it so, that you won&rsquo;t know it agin when you do want
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl obeyed. Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the
      pillow: turning his eyes upon her face. They closed; opened again; closed
      once more; again opened. He shifted his position restlessly; and, after
      dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as often springing
      up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about him, was suddenly
      stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of rising, into a deep
      and heavy sleep. The grasp of his hand relaxed; the upraised arm fell
      languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a profound trance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The laudanum has taken effect at last,&rsquo; murmured the girl, as she rose
      from the bedside. &lsquo;I may be too late, even now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl: looking fearfully
      round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she
      expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes&rsquo;s heavy hand upon her
      shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the robber&rsquo;s
      lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with noiseless touch,
      hurried from the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which
      she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has it long gone the half-hour?&rsquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;ll strike the hour in another quarter,&rsquo; said the man: raising his
      lantern to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,&rsquo; muttered Nancy:
      brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues
      through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards the
      West-End of London. The clock struck ten, increasing her impatience. She
      tore along the narrow pavement: elbowing the passengers from side to side;
      and darting almost under the horses&rsquo; heads, crossed crowded streets, where
      clusters of persons were eagerly watching their opportunity to do the
      like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The woman is mad!&rsquo; said the people, turning to look after her as she
      rushed away.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were
      comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still
      greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past. Some quickened
      their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening at such an
      unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back, surprised at
      her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and when she neared
      her place of destination, she was alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park. As
      the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided her to
      the spot, the clock struck eleven. She had loitered for a few paces as
      though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the sound
      determined her, and she stepped into the hall. The porter&rsquo;s seat was
      vacant. She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced towards
      the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, young woman!&rsquo; said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a door
      behind her, &lsquo;who do you want here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lady who is stopping in this house,&rsquo; answered the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A lady!&rsquo; was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. &lsquo;What lady?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Maylie,&rsquo; said Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied only
      by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her. To him,
      Nancy repeated her request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What name am I to say?&rsquo; asked the waiter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s of no use saying any,&rsquo; replied Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor business?&rsquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nor that neither,&rsquo; rejoined the girl. &lsquo;I must see the lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come!&rsquo; said the man, pushing her towards the door. &lsquo;None of this. Take
      yourself off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be carried out if I go!&rsquo; said the girl violently; &lsquo;and I can make
      that a job that two of you won&rsquo;t like to do. Isn&rsquo;t there anybody here,&rsquo; 
      she said, looking round, &lsquo;that will see a simple message carried for a
      poor wretch like me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who with
      some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward to
      interfere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take it up for her, Joe; can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said this person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the good?&rsquo; replied the man. &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t suppose the young lady will
      see such as her; do you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This allusion to Nancy&rsquo;s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of
      chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great
      fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly
      advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do what you like with me,&rsquo; said the girl, turning to the men again; &lsquo;but
      do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for God
      Almighty&rsquo;s sake.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that the
      man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s it to be?&rsquo; said the man, with one foot on the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,&rsquo; said
      Nancy; &lsquo;and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to say,
      she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned out of
      doors as an impostor.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; said the man, &lsquo;you&rsquo;re coming it strong!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You give the message,&rsquo; said the girl firmly; &lsquo;and let me hear the
      answer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man ran upstairs. Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless,
      listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn, of
      which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they became
      still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman was to walk
      upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s no good being proper in this world,&rsquo; said the first housemaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,&rsquo; said the
      second.
    </p>
    <p>
      The third contented herself with wondering &lsquo;what ladies was made of&rsquo;; and
      the fourth took the first in a quartette of &lsquo;Shameful!&rsquo; with which the
      Dianas concluded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy
      followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber, lighted
      by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XL &mdash; A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST
      CHAMBER
    </h2>
    <p>
      The girl&rsquo;s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most
      noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the
      woman&rsquo;s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light step
      approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered, and
      thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another moment
      contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame, and
      shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with whom she
      had sought this interview.
    </p>
    <p>
      But struggling with these better feelings was pride,&mdash;the vice of the
      lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and
      self-assured. The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the fallen
      outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the jails and
      hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,&mdash;even this
      degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the womanly
      feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected her with
      that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so many, many
      traces when a very child.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which
      presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending
      them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as she
      said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a hard matter to get to see you, lady. If I had taken offence, and
      gone away, as many would have done, you&rsquo;d have been sorry for it one day,
      and not without reason either.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,&rsquo; replied Rose. &lsquo;Do
      not think of that. Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the person you
      inquired for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the
      absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl
      completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, lady, lady!&rsquo; she said, clasping her hands passionately before her
      face, &lsquo;if there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,&mdash;there
      would&mdash;there would!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sit down,&rsquo; said Rose, earnestly. &lsquo;If you are in poverty or affliction I
      shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,&mdash;I shall indeed. Sit
      down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me stand, lady,&rsquo; said the girl, still weeping, &lsquo;and do not speak to
      me so kindly till you know me better. It is growing late. Is&mdash;is&mdash;that
      door shut?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance in
      case she should require it. &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;I am about to put my life and the lives of
      others in your hands. I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to old
      Fagin&rsquo;s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You!&rsquo; said Rose Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I, lady!&rsquo; replied the girl. &lsquo;I am the infamous creature you have heard
      of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first moment I
      can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets have known any
      better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so help me God! Do
      not mind shrinking openly from me, lady. I am younger than you would
      think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The poorest women fall
      back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What dreadful things are these!&rsquo; said Rose, involuntarily falling from
      her strange companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,&rsquo; cried the girl, &lsquo;that you had
      friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you were
      never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness, and&mdash;and&mdash;something
      worse than all&mdash;as I have been from my cradle. I may use the word,
      for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will be my deathbed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I pity you!&rsquo; said Rose, in a broken voice. &lsquo;It wrings my heart to hear
      you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven bless you for your goodness!&rsquo; rejoined the girl. &lsquo;If you knew what
      I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away from
      those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to tell
      you what I have overheard. Do you know a man named Monks?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He knows you,&rsquo; replied the girl; &lsquo;and knew you were here, for it was by
      hearing him tell the place that I found you out.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard the name,&rsquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then he goes by some other amongst us,&rsquo; rejoined the girl, &lsquo;which I more
      than thought before. Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put into
      your house on the night of the robbery, I&mdash;suspecting this man&mdash;listened
      to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark. I found out,
      from what I heard, that Monks&mdash;the man I asked you about, you know&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Rose, &lsquo;I understand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&mdash;That Monks,&rsquo; pursued the girl, &lsquo;had seen him accidently with two
      of our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be
      the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn&rsquo;t make out why. A
      bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he should have
      a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a thief, which this
      Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For what purpose?&rsquo; asked Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of
      finding out,&rsquo; said the girl; &lsquo;and there are not many people besides me
      that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery. But I
      did; and I saw him no more till last night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what occurred then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you, lady. Last night he came again. Again they went upstairs,
      and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray me, again
      listened at the door. The first words I heard Monks say were these: &ldquo;So
      the only proofs of the boy&rsquo;s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and
      the old hag that received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin.&rdquo;
       They laughed, and talked of his success in doing this; and Monks, talking
      on about the boy, and getting very wild, said that though he had got the
      young devil&rsquo;s money safely now, he&rsquo;d rather have had it the other way;
      for, what a game it would have been to have brought down the boast of the
      father&rsquo;s will, by driving him through every jail in town, and then hauling
      him up for some capital felony which Fagin could easily manage, after
      having made a good profit of him besides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is all this!&rsquo; said Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,&rsquo; replied the girl. &lsquo;Then,
      he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to yours, that
      if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy&rsquo;s life without bringing
      his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn&rsquo;t, he&rsquo;d be upon the
      watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he took advantage of his
      birth and history, he might harm him yet. &ldquo;In short, Fagin,&rdquo; he says, &ldquo;Jew
      as you are, you never laid such snares as I&rsquo;ll contrive for my young
      brother, Oliver.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;His brother!&rsquo; exclaimed Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Those were his words,&rsquo; said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had
      scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes
      haunted her perpetually. &lsquo;And more. When he spoke of you and the other
      lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against him,
      that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said there was
      some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds of thousands
      of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who your two-legged
      spaniel was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You do not mean,&rsquo; said Rose, turning very pale, &lsquo;to tell me that this was
      said in earnest?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,&rsquo; replied the girl,
      shaking her head. &lsquo;He is an earnest man when his hatred is up. I know many
      who do worse things; but I&rsquo;d rather listen to them all a dozen times, than
      to that Monks once. It is growing late, and I have to reach home without
      suspicion of having been on such an errand as this. I must get back
      quickly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what can I do?&rsquo; said Rose. &lsquo;To what use can I turn this communication
      without you? Back! Why do you wish to return to companions you paint in
      such terrible colors? If you repeat this information to a gentleman whom I
      can summon in an instant from the next room, you can be consigned to some
      place of safety without half an hour&rsquo;s delay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish to go back,&rsquo; said the girl. &lsquo;I must go back, because&mdash;how can
      I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?&mdash;because among the
      men I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all;
      that I can&rsquo;t leave: no, not even to be saved from the life I am leading
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your having interfered in this dear boy&rsquo;s behalf before,&rsquo; said Rose;
      &lsquo;your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard;
      your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your evident
      contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you might yet
      be reclaimed. Oh!&rsquo; said the earnest girl, folding her hands as the tears
      coursed down her face, &lsquo;do not turn a deaf ear to the entreaties of one of
      your own sex; the first&mdash;the first, I do believe, who ever appealed
      to you in the voice of pity and compassion. Do hear my words, and let me
      save you yet, for better things.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lady,&rsquo; cried the girl, sinking on her knees, &lsquo;dear, sweet, angel lady,
      you <i>are</i> the first that ever blessed me with such words as these,
      and if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life
      of sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is never too late,&rsquo; said Rose, &lsquo;for penitence and atonement.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; &lsquo;I cannot leave
      him now! I could not be his death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why should you be?&rsquo; asked Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing could save him,&rsquo; cried the girl. &lsquo;If I told others what I have
      told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die. He is the
      boldest, and has been so cruel!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it possible,&rsquo; cried Rose, &lsquo;that for such a man as this, you can resign
      every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue? It is madness.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know what it is,&rsquo; answered the girl; &lsquo;I only know that it is so,
      and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and wretched as
      myself. I must go back. Whether it is God&rsquo;s wrath for the wrong I have
      done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through every suffering
      and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew that I was to die by
      his hand at last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What am I to do?&rsquo; said Rose. &lsquo;I should not let you depart from me thus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should, lady, and I know you will,&rsquo; rejoined the girl, rising. &lsquo;You
      will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness, and forced
      no promise from you, as I might have done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?&rsquo; said Rose. &lsquo;This
      mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me, benefit
      Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a
      secret, and advise you what to do,&rsquo; rejoined the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where can I find you again when it is necessary?&rsquo; asked Rose. &lsquo;I do
      not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will you be
      walking or passing at any settled period from this time?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and come
      alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I shall not
      be watched or followed?&rsquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise you solemnly,&rsquo; answered Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,&rsquo; said the
      girl without hesitation, &lsquo;I will walk on London Bridge if I am alive.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay another moment,&rsquo; interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly
      towards the door. &lsquo;Think once again on your own condition, and the
      opportunity you have of escaping from it. You have a claim on me: not only
      as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost almost
      beyond redemption. Will you return to this gang of robbers, and to this
      man, when a word can save you? What fascination is it that can take you
      back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery? Oh! is there no chord
      in your heart that I can touch! Is there nothing left, to which I can
      appeal against this terrible infatuation!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,&rsquo; replied the
      girl steadily, &lsquo;give away your hearts, love will carry you all lengths&mdash;even
      such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers, everything, to fill
      them. When such as I, who have no certain roof but the coffin-lid, and no
      friend in sickness or death but the hospital nurse, set our rotten hearts
      on any man, and let him fill the place that has been a blank through all
      our wretched lives, who can hope to cure us? Pity us, lady&mdash;pity us
      for having only one feeling of the woman left, and for having that turned,
      by a heavy judgment, from a comfort and a pride, into a new means of
      violence and suffering.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will,&rsquo; said Rose, after a pause, &lsquo;take some money from me, which may
      enable you to live without dishonesty&mdash;at all events until we meet
      again?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a penny,&rsquo; replied the girl, waving her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,&rsquo; said Rose,
      stepping gently forward. &lsquo;I wish to serve you indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would serve me best, lady,&rsquo; replied the girl, wringing her hands, &lsquo;if
      you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think of
      what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be something not
      to die in the hell in which I have lived. God bless you, sweet lady, and
      send as much happiness on your head as I have brought shame on mine!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away; while
      Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which had more
      the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank into a
      chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLI &mdash; CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT
      SUPRISES, LIKE MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While
      she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in
      which Oliver&rsquo;s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the
      confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed, had
      reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl. Her words and manner had
      touched Rose Maylie&rsquo;s heart; and, mingled with her love for her young
      charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour, was her fond
      wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing for
      some weeks to a distant part of the coast. It was now midnight of the
      first day. What course of action could she determine upon, which could be
      adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone the journey
      without exciting suspicion?
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but Rose
      was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman&rsquo;s impetuosity, and
      foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first explosion of his
      indignation, he would regard the instrument of Oliver&rsquo;s recapture, to
      trust him with the secret, when her representations in the girl&rsquo;s behalf
      could be seconded by no experienced person. These were all reasons for the
      greatest caution and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to
      Mrs. Maylie, whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference
      with the worthy doctor on the subject. As to resorting to any legal
      adviser, even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought
      of, for the same reason. Once the thought occurred to her of seeking
      assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last
      parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when&mdash;the
      tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection&mdash;he
      might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course and
      then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive
      consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and
      anxious night. After more communing with herself next day, she arrived at
      the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it be painful to him,&rsquo; she thought, &lsquo;to come back here, how painful it
      will be to me! But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he may come
      himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me&mdash;he did when he went
      away. I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us both.&rsquo; And here
      Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the very paper which was
      to be her messenger should not see her weep.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and had
      considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without writing
      the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the streets, with Mr.
      Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such breathless haste and
      violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new cause of alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What makes you look so flurried?&rsquo; asked Rose, advancing to meet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,&rsquo; replied the boy. &lsquo;Oh
      dear! To think that I should see him at last, and you should be able to
      know that I have told you the truth!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,&rsquo; said Rose,
      soothing him. &lsquo;But what is this?&mdash;of whom do you speak?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen the gentleman,&rsquo; replied Oliver, scarcely able to articulate,
      &lsquo;the gentleman who was so good to me&mdash;Mr. Brownlow, that we have so
      often talked about.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; asked Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Getting out of a coach,&rsquo; replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight, &lsquo;and
      going into a house. I didn&rsquo;t speak to him&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t speak to him,
      for he didn&rsquo;t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go up to
      him. But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they said he
      did. Look here,&rsquo; said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, &lsquo;here it is;
      here&rsquo;s where he lives&mdash;I&rsquo;m going there directly! Oh, dear me, dear
      me! What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak again!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many other
      incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was Craven
      Street, in the Strand. She very soon determined upon turning the discovery
      to account.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quick!&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready to go
      with me. I will take you there directly, without a minute&rsquo;s loss of time.
      I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour, and be ready
      as soon as you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five
      minutes they were on their way to Craven Street. When they arrived there,
      Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the old
      gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,
      requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business. The servant soon
      returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him into an
      upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman of
      benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat. At no great distance from
      whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and gaiters;
      who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting with his
      hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin propped thereupon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear me,&rsquo; said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising
      with great politeness, &lsquo;I beg your pardon, young lady&mdash;I imagined it
      was some importunate person who&mdash;I beg you will excuse me. Be seated,
      pray.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?&rsquo; said Rose, glancing from the other
      gentleman to the one who had spoken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is my name,&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;This is my friend, Mr.
      Grimwig. Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I believe,&rsquo; interposed Miss Maylie, &lsquo;that at this period of our
      interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away. If I
      am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I wish to
      speak to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow inclined his head. Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very stiff
      bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and dropped
      into it again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,&rsquo; said Rose, naturally
      embarrassed; &lsquo;but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a very
      dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest in
      hearing of him again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed!&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oliver Twist you knew him as,&rsquo; replied Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been
      affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with a
      great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his features
      every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged in a
      prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed so much
      emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into his former
      attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long deep whistle,
      which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air, but to die away
      in the innermost recesses of his stomach.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not
      expressed in the same eccentric manner. He drew his chair nearer to Miss
      Maylie&rsquo;s, and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the
      question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which
      nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce
      any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once induced
      to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven&rsquo;s name put me in possession of
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A bad one! I&rsquo;ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,&rsquo; growled Mr. Grimwig,
      speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle of his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,&rsquo; said Rose, colouring;
      &lsquo;and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his years, has
      planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do honour to
      many who have numbered his days six times over.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m only sixty-one,&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. &lsquo;And, as
      the devil&rsquo;s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I don&rsquo;t
      see the application of that remark.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;he does not mean
      what he says.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, he does,&rsquo; growled Mr. Grimwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, he does not,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll eat his head, if he doesn&rsquo;t,&rsquo; growled Mr. Grimwig.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And he&rsquo;d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,&rsquo; responded Mr.
      Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and
      afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Miss Maylie,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;to return to the subject in which
      your humanity is so much interested. Will you let me know what
      intelligence you have of this poor child: allowing me to promise that I
      exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since I
      have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had
      imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob
      me, has been considerably shaken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a few
      natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr. Brownlow&rsquo;s
      house; reserving Nancy&rsquo;s information for that gentleman&rsquo;s private ear, and
      concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow, for some months past,
      had been not being able to meet with his former benefactor and friend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank God!&rsquo; said the old gentleman. &lsquo;This is great happiness to me, great
      happiness. But you have not told me where he is now, Miss Maylie. You must
      pardon my finding fault with you,&mdash;but why not have brought him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is waiting in a coach at the door,&rsquo; replied Rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At this door!&rsquo; cried the old gentleman. With which he hurried out of the
      room, down the stairs, up the coach-steps, and into the coach, without
      another word.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head, and
      converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot, described three
      distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and the table; sitting
      in it all the time. After performing this evolution, he rose and limped as
      fast as he could up and down the room at least a dozen times, and then
      stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed her without the slightest preface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual
      proceeding. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid. I&rsquo;m old enough to be your grandfather.
      You&rsquo;re a sweet girl. I like you. Here they are!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former seat,
      Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig received
      very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had been the only
      reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver&rsquo;s behalf, Rose Maylie would
      have been well repaid.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Brownlow, ringing the bell. &lsquo;Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and dropping a
      curtsey at the door, waited for orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, rather
      testily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that I do, sir,&rsquo; replied the old lady. &lsquo;People&rsquo;s eyes, at my time
      of life, don&rsquo;t improve with age, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I could have told you that,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;but put on your
      glasses, and see if you can&rsquo;t find out what you were wanted for, will
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But
      Oliver&rsquo;s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to
      his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;God be good to me!&rsquo; cried the old lady, embracing him; &lsquo;it is my innocent
      boy!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My dear old nurse!&rsquo; cried Oliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He would come back&mdash;I knew he would,&rsquo; said the old lady, holding him
      in her arms. &lsquo;How well he looks, and how like a gentleman&rsquo;s son he is
      dressed again! Where have you been, this long, long while? Ah! the same
      sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad. I have
      never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every day,
      side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone since I was
      a lightsome young creature.&rsquo; Running on thus, and now holding Oliver from
      her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to her and passing her
      fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul laughed and wept upon his
      neck by turns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led the
      way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration of her
      interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise and
      perplexity. Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in her
      friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance. The old gentleman considered
      that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold solemn
      conference with the worthy doctor himself. To afford him an early
      opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged that he
      should call at the hotel at eight o&rsquo;clock that evening, and that in the
      meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all that had
      occurred. These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver returned home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor&rsquo;s wrath.
      Nancy&rsquo;s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a
      shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the
      first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff; and
      actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the
      assistance of those worthies. And, doubtless, he would, in this first
      outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment&rsquo;s
      consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in part,
      by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was himself of
      an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and representations
      as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his hotbrained purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what the devil is to be done?&rsquo; said the impetuous doctor, when they
      had rejoined the two ladies. &lsquo;Are we to pass a vote of thanks to all these
      vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred pounds, or
      so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some slight
      acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not exactly that,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; &lsquo;but we must proceed
      gently and with great care.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentleness and care,&rsquo; exclaimed the doctor. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d send them one and all to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind where,&rsquo; interposed Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;But reflect whether sending
      them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What object?&rsquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Simply, the discovery of Oliver&rsquo;s parentage, and regaining for him the
      inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently
      deprived.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief; &lsquo;I
      almost forgot that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; pursued Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;placing this poor girl entirely out of
      the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these scoundrels to
      justice without compromising her safety, what good should we bring about?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,&rsquo; suggested the
      doctor, &lsquo;and transporting the rest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; &lsquo;but no doubt they will bring
      that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step in to
      forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very Quixotic
      act, in direct opposition to our own interest&mdash;or at least to
      Oliver&rsquo;s, which is the same thing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How?&rsquo; inquired the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thus. It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in getting
      to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man, Monks, upon
      his knees. That can only be done by stratagem, and by catching him when he
      is not surrounded by these people. For, suppose he were apprehended, we
      have no proof against him. He is not even (so far as we know, or as the
      facts appear to us) concerned with the gang in any of their robberies. If
      he were not discharged, it is very unlikely that he could receive any
      further punishment than being committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond;
      and of course ever afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed
      that he might as well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an
      idiot.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the doctor impetuously, &lsquo;I put it to you again, whether you
      think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be considered
      binding; a promise made with the best and kindest intentions, but really&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow,
      interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. &lsquo;The promise shall be kept. I
      don&rsquo;t think it will, in the slightest degree, interfere with our
      proceedings. But, before we can resolve upon any precise course of action,
      it will be necessary to see the girl; to ascertain from her whether she
      will point out this Monks, on the understanding that he is to be dealt
      with by us, and not by the law; or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to
      procure from her such an account of his haunts and description of his
      person, as will enable us to identify him. She cannot be seen until next
      Sunday night; this is Tuesday. I would suggest that in the meantime, we
      remain perfectly quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver
      himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving a
      delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course
      occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very
      strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman&rsquo;s proposition was carried
      unanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig. He is
      a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material
      assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted the
      Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of course, in
      twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not, you must
      determine for yourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in
      mine,&rsquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must put it to the vote,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;who may he be?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That lady&rsquo;s son, and this young lady&rsquo;s&mdash;very old friend,&rsquo; said the
      doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an expressive
      glance at her niece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this
      motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and
      Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We stay in town, of course,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &lsquo;while there remains the
      slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of success. I
      will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the object in which we
      are all so deeply interested, and I am content to remain here, if it be
      for twelve months, so long as you assure me that any hope remains.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good!&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;And as I see on the faces about me, a
      disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to
      corroborate Oliver&rsquo;s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me
      stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may deem
      it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story. Believe me, I make
      this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite hopes destined
      never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and disappointments
      already quite numerous enough. Come! Supper has been announced, and young
      Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will have begun to think, by
      this time, that we have wearied of his company, and entered into some dark
      conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the world.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and
      escorted her into the supper-room. Mr. Losberne followed, leading Rose;
      and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLII &mdash; AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER&rsquo;S, EXHIBITING DECIDED
      MARKS OF GENIUS, BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS
    </h2>
    <p>
      Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on
      her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London, by
      the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that this
      history should bestow some attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as a
      male and female: for the former was one of those long-limbed, knock-kneed,
      shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign any precise age,&mdash;looking
      as they do, when they are yet boys, like undergrown men, and when they are
      almost men, like overgrown boys. The woman was young, but of a robust and
      hardy make, as she need have been to bear the weight of the heavy bundle
      which was strapped to her back. Her companion was not encumbered with much
      luggage, as there merely dangled from a stick which he carried over his
      shoulder, a small parcel wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently
      light enough. This circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which
      were of unusual extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen
      paces in advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an
      impatient jerk of the head: as if reproaching her tardiness, and urging
      her to greater exertion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any
      object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider passage
      for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until they passed
      through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller stopped and called
      impatiently to his companion,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on, can&rsquo;t yer? What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a heavy load, I can tell you,&rsquo; said the female, coming up, almost
      breathless with fatigue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heavy! What are yer talking about? What are yer made for?&rsquo; rejoined the
      male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the other
      shoulder. &lsquo;Oh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain&rsquo;t enough to
      tire anybody&rsquo;s patience out, I don&rsquo;t know what is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is it much farther?&rsquo; asked the woman, resting herself against a bank, and
      looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Much farther! Yer as good as there,&rsquo; said the long-legged tramper,
      pointing out before him. &lsquo;Look there! Those are the lights of London.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;re a good two mile off, at least,&rsquo; said the woman despondingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind whether they&rsquo;re two mile off, or twenty,&rsquo; said Noah Claypole;
      for he it was; &lsquo;but get up and come on, or I&rsquo;ll kick yer, and so I give
      yer notice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As Noah&rsquo;s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road
      while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution, the
      woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?&rsquo; she asked, after they had
      walked a few hundred yards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How should I know?&rsquo; replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably
      impaired by walking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Near, I hope,&rsquo; said Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, not near,&rsquo; replied Mr. Claypole. &lsquo;There! Not near; so don&rsquo;t think
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I tell yer that I don&rsquo;t mean to do a thing, that&rsquo;s enough, without
      any why or because either,&rsquo; replied Mr. Claypole with dignity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, you needn&rsquo;t be so cross,&rsquo; said his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pretty thing it would be, wouldn&rsquo;t it to go and stop at the very first
      public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up after us,
      might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart with
      handcuffs on,&rsquo; said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone. &lsquo;No! I shall go and
      lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop till we
      come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on. &lsquo;Cod, yer may
      thanks yer stars I&rsquo;ve got a head; for if we hadn&rsquo;t gone, at first, the
      wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer&rsquo;d have been locked
      up hard and fast a week ago, my lady. And serve yer right for being a
      fool.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know I ain&rsquo;t as cunning as you are,&rsquo; replied Charlotte; &lsquo;but don&rsquo;t put
      all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up. You would have
      been if I had been, any way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,&rsquo; said Mr. Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I took it for you, Noah, dear,&rsquo; rejoined Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did I keep it?&rsquo; asked Mr. Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you are,&rsquo; 
      said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm through
      his.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole&rsquo;s habit to repose
      a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be observed, in
      justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte to this extent,
      in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be found on her:
      which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his innocence of any
      theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of escape. Of course, he
      entered at this juncture, into no explanation of his motives, and they
      walked on very lovingly together.
    </p>
    <p>
      In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without halting,
      until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely judged, from
      the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that London began in
      earnest. Just pausing to observe which appeared the most crowded streets,
      and consequently the most to be avoided, he crossed into Saint John&rsquo;s
      Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of the intricate and dirty ways,
      which, lying between Gray&rsquo;s Inn Lane and Smithfield, render that part of
      the town one of the lowest and worst that improvement has left in the
      midst of London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after him;
      now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole external
      character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as some
      fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his purpose.
      At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in appearance and more
      dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed over and surveyed it
      from the opposite pavement, graciously announced his intention of putting
      up there, for the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So give us the bundle,&rsquo; said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman&rsquo;s
      shoulders, and slinging it over his own; &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t yer speak, except when
      yer spoke to. What&rsquo;s the name of the house&mdash;t-h-r&mdash;three what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cripples,&rsquo; said Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three Cripples,&rsquo; repeated Noah, &lsquo;and a very good sign too. Now, then!
      Keep close at my heels, and come along.&rsquo; With these injunctions, he pushed
      the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house, followed by
      his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows on
      the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at Noah,
      and Noah stared very hard at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy&rsquo;s dress, there might have been
      some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had discarded
      the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his leathers, there
      seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting so much attention
      in a public-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is this the Three Cripples?&rsquo; asked Noah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is the dabe of this &lsquo;ouse,&rsquo; replied the Jew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country, recommended
      us here,&rsquo; said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her attention to
      this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and perhaps to warn her
      to betray no surprise. &lsquo;We want to sleep here to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;b dot certaid you cad,&rsquo; said Barney, who was the attendant sprite; &lsquo;but
      I&rsquo;ll idquire.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer while
      yer inquiring, will yer?&rsquo; said Noah.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting the
      required viands before them; having done which, he informed the travellers
      that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable couple to their
      refreshment.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0191.jpg" alt="0191" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0191.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps lower,
      so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small curtain
      which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the last-named
      apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only look down
      upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of being
      observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between which and a
      large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but could, by
      applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable distinctness,
      their subject of conversation. The landlord of the house had not withdrawn
      his eye from this place of espial for five minutes, and Barney had only
      just returned from making the communication above related, when Fagin, in
      the course of his evening&rsquo;s business, came into the bar to inquire after
      some of his young pupils.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; said Barney: &lsquo;stradegers id the next roob.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Strangers!&rsquo; repeated the old man in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! Ad rub uds too,&rsquo; added Barney. &lsquo;Frob the cuttry, but subthig in your
      way, or I&rsquo;b bistaked.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass, from
      which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from the
      dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses of both
      to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aha!&rsquo; he whispered, looking round to Barney, &lsquo;I like that fellow&rsquo;s looks.
      He&rsquo;d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already. Don&rsquo;t make
      as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear &lsquo;em talk&mdash;let me
      hear &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the
      partition, listened attentively: with a subtle and eager look upon his
      face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So I mean to be a gentleman,&rsquo; said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs,
      and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had arrived
      too late to hear. &lsquo;No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a gentleman&rsquo;s
      life for me: and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should like that well enough, dear,&rsquo; replied Charlotte; &lsquo;but tills
      ain&rsquo;t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tills be blowed!&rsquo; said Mr. Claypole; &lsquo;there&rsquo;s more things besides tills
      to be emptied.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; asked his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pockets, women&rsquo;s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!&rsquo; said Mr.
      Claypole, rising with the porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But you can&rsquo;t do all that, dear,&rsquo; said Charlotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall look out to get into company with them as can,&rsquo; replied Noah.
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you yourself
      are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and deceitful
      creetur as yer can be when I let yer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!&rsquo; exclaimed Charlotte, imprinting
      a kiss upon his ugly face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There, that&rsquo;ll do: don&rsquo;t yer be too affectionate, in case I&rsquo;m cross with
      yer,&rsquo; said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity. &lsquo;I should like to
      be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of &lsquo;em, and follering
      &lsquo;em about, unbeknown to themselves. That would suit me, if there was good
      profit; and if we could only get in with some gentleman of this sort, I
      say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound note you&rsquo;ve got,&mdash;especially
      as we don&rsquo;t very well know how to get rid of it ourselves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot
      with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents, nodded
      condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he appeared
      greatly refreshed. He was meditating another, when the sudden opening of
      the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The stranger was Mr. Fagin. And very amiable he looked, and a very low bow
      he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest table,
      ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,&rsquo; said Fagin,
      rubbing his hands. &lsquo;From the country, I see, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How do yer see that?&rsquo; asked Noah Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We have not so much dust as that in London,&rsquo; replied Fagin, pointing from
      Noah&rsquo;s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two bundles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yer a sharp feller,&rsquo; said Noah. &lsquo;Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew, sinking
      his voice to a confidential whisper; &lsquo;and that&rsquo;s the truth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his
      right forefinger,&mdash;a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though
      not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being large
      enough for the purpose. However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret the
      endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and put
      about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good stuff that,&rsquo; observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Dear!&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;A man need be always emptying a till, or a pocket, or
      a woman&rsquo;s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank, if he drinks
      it regularly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he
      fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a
      countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t mind me, my dear,&rsquo; said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. &lsquo;Ha! ha!
      it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very lucky it
      was only me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t take it,&rsquo; stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs like
      an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could under
      his chair; &lsquo;it was all her doing; yer&rsquo;ve got it now, Charlotte, yer know
      yer have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No matter who&rsquo;s got it, or who did it, my dear,&rsquo; replied Fagin, glancing,
      nevertheless, with a hawk&rsquo;s eye at the girl and the two bundles. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m in
      that way myself, and I like you for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In what way?&rsquo; asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In that way of business,&rsquo; rejoined Fagin; &lsquo;and so are the people of the
      house. You&rsquo;ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe here as
      you could be. There is not a safer place in all this town than is the
      Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so. And I have taken a fancy to
      you and the young woman; so I&rsquo;ve said the word, and you may make your
      minds easy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah Claypole&rsquo;s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but his
      body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into various
      uncouth positions: eyeing his new friend meanwhile with mingled fear and
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you more,&rsquo; said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by dint
      of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. &lsquo;I have got a friend that I
      think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right way, where
      you can take whatever department of the business you think will suit you
      best at first, and be taught all the others.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,&rsquo; replied Noah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?&rsquo; inquired Fagin,
      shrugging his shoulders. &lsquo;Here! Let me have a word with you outside.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,&rsquo; said Noah, getting his
      legs by gradual degrees abroad again. &lsquo;She&rsquo;ll take the luggage upstairs
      the while. Charlotte, see to them bundles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed
      without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off
      with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She&rsquo;s kept tolerably well under, ain&rsquo;t she?&rsquo; he asked as he resumed his
      seat: in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Quite perfect,&rsquo; rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re a
      genius, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I suppose if I wasn&rsquo;t, I shouldn&rsquo;t be here,&rsquo; replied Noah. &lsquo;But, I
      say, she&rsquo;ll be back if yer lose time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, what do you think?&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;If you was to like my friend, could
      you do better than join him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is he in a good way of business; that&rsquo;s where it is!&rsquo; responded Noah,
      winking one of his little eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best society
      in the profession.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Regular town-maders?&rsquo; asked Mr. Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a countryman among &lsquo;em; and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d take you, even on my
      recommendation, if he didn&rsquo;t run rather short of assistants just now,&rsquo; 
      replied Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Should I have to hand over?&rsquo; said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It couldn&rsquo;t possibly be done without,&rsquo; replied Fagin, in a most decided
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Twenty pound, though&mdash;it&rsquo;s a lot of money!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not when it&rsquo;s in a note you can&rsquo;t get rid of,&rsquo; retorted Fagin. &lsquo;Number
      and date taken, I suppose? Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah! It&rsquo;s not worth
      much to him. It&rsquo;ll have to go abroad, and he couldn&rsquo;t sell it for a great
      deal in the market.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When could I see him?&rsquo; asked Noah doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Um!&rsquo; said Noah. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the wages?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Live like a gentleman&mdash;board and lodging, pipes and spirits free&mdash;half
      of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least comprehensive,
      would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he been a perfectly
      free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected that, in the event of
      his refusal, it was in the power of his new acquaintance to give him up to
      justice immediately (and more unlikely things had come to pass), he
      gradually relented, and said he thought that would suit him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, yer see,&rsquo; observed Noah, &lsquo;as she will be able to do a good deal, I
      should like to take something very light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A little fancy work?&rsquo; suggested Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! something of that sort,&rsquo; replied Noah. &lsquo;What do you think would suit
      me now? Something not too trying for the strength, and not very dangerous,
      you know. That&rsquo;s the sort of thing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my dear,&rsquo; 
      said Fagin. &lsquo;My friend wants somebody who would do that well, very much.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn&rsquo;t mind turning my hand to it
      sometimes,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; &lsquo;but it wouldn&rsquo;t pay by itself,
      you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s true!&rsquo; observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.
      &lsquo;No, it might not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think, then?&rsquo; asked Noah, anxiously regarding him. &lsquo;Something
      in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not much more risk
      than being at home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you think of the old ladies?&rsquo; asked Fagin. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s a good deal
      of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running round the
      corner.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?&rsquo; asked Noah,
      shaking his head. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t think that would answer my purpose. Ain&rsquo;t there
      any other line open?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop!&rsquo; said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah&rsquo;s knee. &lsquo;The kinchin lay.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; demanded Mr. Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The kinchins, my dear,&rsquo; said Fagin, &lsquo;is the young children that&rsquo;s sent on
      errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay is
      just to take their money away&mdash;they&rsquo;ve always got it ready in their
      hands,&mdash;then knock &lsquo;em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if
      there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt
      itself. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy. &lsquo;Lord,
      that&rsquo;s the very thing!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure it is,&rsquo; replied Fagin; &lsquo;and you can have a few good beats
      chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like
      that, where they&rsquo;re always going errands; and you can upset as many
      kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a
      burst of laughter both long and loud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, that&rsquo;s all right!&rsquo; said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and
      Charlotte had returned. &lsquo;What time to-morrow shall we say?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will ten do?&rsquo; asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent, &lsquo;What
      name shall I tell my good friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Bolter,&rsquo; replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such emergency.
      &lsquo;Mr. Morris Bolter. This is Mrs. Bolter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mrs. Bolter&rsquo;s humble servant,&rsquo; said Fagin, bowing with grotesque
      politeness. &lsquo;I hope I shall know her better very shortly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?&rsquo; thundered Mr. Claypole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, Noah, dear!&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,&rsquo; said Mr. Morris
      Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin. &lsquo;You understand?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, I understand&mdash;perfectly,&rsquo; replied Fagin, telling the truth
      for once. &lsquo;Good-night! Good-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah Claypole,
      bespeaking his good lady&rsquo;s attention, proceeded to enlighten her relative
      to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness and air of
      superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex, but a
      gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on the
      kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.

      &lsquo;Every man&rsquo;s his own friend, my dear,&rsquo; replied Fagin, with his most
      insinuating grin. &lsquo;He hasn&rsquo;t as good a one as himself anywhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Except sometimes,&rsquo; replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of
      the world. &lsquo;Some people are nobody&rsquo;s enemies but their own, yer know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t believe that,&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;When a man&rsquo;s his own enemy, it&rsquo;s only
      because he&rsquo;s too much his own friend; not because he&rsquo;s careful for
      everybody but himself. Pooh! pooh! There ain&rsquo;t such a thing in nature.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There oughn&rsquo;t to be, if there is,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bolter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That stands to reason. Some conjurers say that number three is the magic
      number, and some say number seven. It&rsquo;s neither, my friend, neither. It&rsquo;s
      number one.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; cried Mr. Bolter. &lsquo;Number one for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In a little community like ours, my dear,&rsquo; said Fagin, who felt it
      necessary to qualify this position, &lsquo;we have a general number one, without
      considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the devil!&rsquo; exclaimed Mr. Bolter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You see,&rsquo; pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, &lsquo;we
      are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must be
      so. For instance, it&rsquo;s your object to take care of number one&mdash;meaning
      yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bolter. &lsquo;Yer about right there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well! You can&rsquo;t take care of yourself, number one, without taking care of
      me, number one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Number two, you mean,&rsquo; said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with the
      quality of selfishness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I don&rsquo;t!&rsquo; retorted Fagin. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m of the same importance to you, as you
      are to yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; interrupted Mr. Bolter, &lsquo;yer a very nice man, and I&rsquo;m very fond
      of yer; but we ain&rsquo;t quite so thick together, as all that comes to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only think,&rsquo; said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out his
      hands; &lsquo;only consider. You&rsquo;ve done what&rsquo;s a very pretty thing, and what I
      love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the cravat round
      your throat, that&rsquo;s so very easily tied and so very difficult to unloose&mdash;in
      plain English, the halter!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it
      inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not in
      substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The gallows,&rsquo; continued Fagin, &lsquo;the gallows, my dear, is an ugly
      finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has
      stopped many a bold fellow&rsquo;s career on the broad highway. To keep in the
      easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course it is,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bolter. &lsquo;What do yer talk about such things
      for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Only to show you my meaning clearly,&rsquo; said the Jew, raising his eyebrows.
      &lsquo;To be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my little business all
      snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number one, the second my
      number one. The more you value your number one, the more careful you must
      be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you at first&mdash;that a
      regard for number one holds us all together, and must do so, unless we
      would all go to pieces in company.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s true,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully. &lsquo;Oh! yer a cunning old
      codger!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no mere
      compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a sense of
      his wily genius, which it was most important that he should entertain in
      the outset of their acquaintance. To strengthen an impression so desirable
      and useful, he followed up the blow by acquainting him, in some detail,
      with the magnitude and extent of his operations; blending truth and
      fiction together, as best served his purpose; and bringing both to bear,
      with so much art, that Mr. Bolter&rsquo;s respect visibly increased, and became
      tempered, at the same time, with a degree of wholesome fear, which it was
      highly desirable to awaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under heavy
      losses,&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;My best hand was taken from me, yesterday morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say he died?&rsquo; cried Mr. Bolter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; replied Fagin, &lsquo;not so bad as that. Not quite so bad.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, I suppose he was&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wanted,&rsquo; interposed Fagin. &lsquo;Yes, he was wanted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very particular?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Bolter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Fagin, &lsquo;not very. He was charged with attempting to pick a
      pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,&mdash;his own, my dear,
      his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it. They remanded
      him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner. Ah! he was worth
      fifty boxes, and I&rsquo;d give the price of as many to have him back. You
      should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known the Dodger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don&rsquo;t yer think so?&rsquo; said Mr. Bolter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m doubtful about it,&rsquo; replied Fagin, with a sigh. &lsquo;If they don&rsquo;t get
      any fresh evidence, it&rsquo;ll only be a summary conviction, and we shall have
      him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it&rsquo;s a case of
      lagging. They know what a clever lad he is; he&rsquo;ll be a lifer. They&rsquo;ll make
      the Artful nothing less than a lifer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?&rsquo; demanded Mr. Bolter. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s
      the good of talking in that way to me; why don&rsquo;t yer speak so as I can
      understand yer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the vulgar
      tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been informed that
      they represented that combination of words, &lsquo;transportation for life,&rsquo; 
      when the dialogue was cut short by the entry of Master Bates, with his
      hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face twisted into a look of
      semi-comical woe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all up, Fagin,&rsquo; said Charley, when he and his new companion had been
      made known to each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They&rsquo;ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more&rsquo;s a coming
      to &lsquo;dentify him; and the Artful&rsquo;s booked for a passage out,&rsquo; replied
      Master Bates. &lsquo;I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and a hatband,
      to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels. To think of Jack
      Dawkins&mdash;lummy Jack&mdash;the Dodger&mdash;the Artful Dodger&mdash;going
      abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box! I never thought he&rsquo;d a
      done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest. Oh, why
      didn&rsquo;t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and go out as a
      gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour nor glory!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master Bates
      sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and
      despondency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. &lsquo;Wasn&rsquo;t he always the
      top-sawyer among you all! Is there one of you that could touch him or come
      near him on any scent! Eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not one,&rsquo; replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret; &lsquo;not
      one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then what do you talk of?&rsquo; replied Fagin angrily; &lsquo;what are you
      blubbering for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Cause it isn&rsquo;t on the rec-ord, is it?&rsquo; said Charley, chafed into perfect
      defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets; &lsquo;&rsquo;cause it
      can&rsquo;t come out in the &lsquo;dictment; &lsquo;cause nobody will never know half of
      what he was. How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar? P&rsquo;raps not be
      there at all. Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr. Bolter
      in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the palsy; &lsquo;see
      what a pride they take in their profession, my dear. Ain&rsquo;t it beautiful?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of
      Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to
      that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind, Charley,&rsquo; said Fagin soothingly; &lsquo;it&rsquo;ll come out, it&rsquo;ll be
      sure to come out. They&rsquo;ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he&rsquo;ll show
      it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers. Think how young he
      is too! What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time of life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, it is a honour that is!&rsquo; said Charley, a little consoled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He shall have all he wants,&rsquo; continued the Jew. &lsquo;He shall be kept in the
      Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman. Like a gentleman! With his beer
      every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he can&rsquo;t
      spend it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, shall he though?&rsquo; cried Charley Bates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ay, that he shall,&rsquo; replied Fagin, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;ll have a big-wig, Charley:
      one that&rsquo;s got the greatest gift of the gab: to carry on his defence; and
      he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we&rsquo;ll read it all
      in the papers&mdash;&ldquo;Artful Dodger&mdash;shrieks of laughter&mdash;here
      the court was convulsed&rdquo;&mdash;eh, Charley, eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha!&rsquo; laughed Master Bates, &lsquo;what a lark that would be, wouldn&rsquo;t it,
      Fagin? I say, how the Artful would bother &lsquo;em wouldn&rsquo;t he?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would!&rsquo; cried Fagin. &lsquo;He shall&mdash;he will!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, to be sure, so he will,&rsquo; repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I see him now,&rsquo; cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So do I,&rsquo; cried Charley Bates. &lsquo;Ha! ha! ha! so do I. I see it all afore
      me, upon my soul I do, Fagin. What a game! What a regular game! All the
      big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of &lsquo;em as
      intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge&rsquo;s own son making a speech
      arter dinner&mdash;ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend&rsquo;s eccentric
      disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to consider
      the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now looked upon him
      as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and exquisite humour, and
      felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time when his old companion
      should have so favourable an opportunity of displaying his abilities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,&rsquo; said
      Fagin. &lsquo;Let me think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Shall I go?&rsquo; asked Charley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not for the world,&rsquo; replied Fagin. &lsquo;Are you mad, my dear, stark mad, that
      you&rsquo;d walk into the very place where&mdash;No, Charley, no. One is enough
      to lose at a time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to go yourself, I suppose?&rsquo; said Charley with a humorous
      leer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That wouldn&rsquo;t quite fit,&rsquo; replied Fagin shaking his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you send this new cove?&rsquo; asked Master Bates, laying his
      hand on Noah&rsquo;s arm. &lsquo;Nobody knows him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, if he didn&rsquo;t mind&mdash;&rsquo; observed Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mind!&rsquo; interposed Charley. &lsquo;What should he have to mind?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Really nothing, my dear,&rsquo; said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, &lsquo;really
      nothing.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,&rsquo; observed Noah, backing towards the
      door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm. &lsquo;No, no&mdash;none
      of that. It&rsquo;s not in my department, that ain&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot department has he got, Fagin?&rsquo; inquired Master Bates, surveying
      Noah&rsquo;s lank form with much disgust. &lsquo;The cutting away when there&rsquo;s
      anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there&rsquo;s everything
      right; is that his branch?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind,&rsquo; retorted Mr. Bolter; &lsquo;and don&rsquo;t yer take liberties with yer
      superiors, little boy, or yer&rsquo;ll find yerself in the wrong shop.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it was
      some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter that
      he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office; that,
      inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had engaged, nor
      any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to the metropolis,
      it was very probable that he was not even suspected of having resorted to
      it for shelter; and that, if he were properly disguised, it would be as
      safe a spot for him to visit as any in London, inasmuch as it would be, of
      all places, the very last, to which he could be supposed likely to resort
      of his own free will.
    </p>
    <p>
      Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much
      greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented, with
      a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin&rsquo;s directions, he
      immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner&rsquo;s frock, velveteen
      breeches, and leather leggings: all of which articles the Jew had at hand.
      He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well garnished with turnpike
      tickets; and a carter&rsquo;s whip. Thus equipped, he was to saunter into the
      office, as some country fellow from Covent Garden market might be supposed
      to do for the gratification of his curiousity; and as he was as awkward,
      ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but
      that he would look the part to perfection.
    </p>
    <p>
      These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs and
      tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by Master
      Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short distance of Bow
      Street. Having described the precise situation of the office, and
      accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk straight up the
      passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off his hat as he went
      into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on alone, and promised to bide
      his return on the spot of their parting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually followed
      the directions he had received, which&mdash;Master Bates being pretty well
      acquainted with the locality&mdash;were so exact that he was enabled to
      gain the magisterial presence without asking any question, or meeting with
      any interruption by the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who were
      huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which was a
      raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the prisoners on
      the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in the middle, and
      a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful locality last named,
      being screened off by a partition which concealed the bench from the
      common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they could) the full
      majesty of justice.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to their
      admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a couple of
      policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the table. A jailer
      stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his nose listlessly with a
      large key, except when he repressed an undue tendency to conversation
      among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or looked sternly up to bid some
      woman &lsquo;Take that baby out,&rsquo; when the gravity of justice was disturbed by
      feeble cries, half-smothered in the mother&rsquo;s shawl, from some meagre
      infant. The room smelt close and unwholesome; the walls were
      dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling blackened. There was an old smoky bust
      over the mantel-shelf, and a dusty clock above the dock&mdash;the only
      thing present, that seemed to go on as it ought; for depravity, or
      poverty, or an habitual acquaintance with both, had left a taint on all
      the animate matter, hardly less unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on
      every inanimate object that frowned upon it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were
      several women who would have done very well for that distinguished
      character&rsquo;s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be supposed
      to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all answering the
      description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen. He waited in a state
      of much suspense and uncertainty until the women, being committed for
      trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly relieved by the appearance
      of another prisoner who he felt at once could be no other than the object
      of his visit.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big
      coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his hat
      in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait altogether
      indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested in an audible
      voice to know what he was placed in that &lsquo;ere disgraceful sitivation for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, will you?&rsquo; said the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m an Englishman, ain&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; rejoined the Dodger. &lsquo;Where are my
      priwileges?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll get your privileges soon enough,&rsquo; retorted the jailer, &lsquo;and pepper
      with &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to say
      to the beaks, if I don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; replied Mr. Dawkins. &lsquo;Now then! Wot is this
      here business? I shall thank the madg&rsquo;strates to dispose of this here
      little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for I&rsquo;ve got
      an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man of my word
      and wery punctual in business matters, he&rsquo;ll go away if I ain&rsquo;t there to
      my time, and then pr&rsquo;aps ther won&rsquo;t be an action for damage against them
      as kep me away. Oh no, certainly not!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a
      view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to
      communicate &lsquo;the names of them two files as was on the bench.&rsquo; Which so
      tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as Master
      Bates could have done if he had heard the request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence there!&rsquo; cried the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this?&rsquo; inquired one of the magistrates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A pick-pocketing case, your worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has the boy ever been here before?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He ought to have been, a many times,&rsquo; replied the jailer. &lsquo;He has been
      pretty well everywhere else. <i>I</i> know him well, your worship.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! you know me, do you?&rsquo; cried the Artful, making a note of the
      statement. &lsquo;Wery good. That&rsquo;s a case of deformation of character, any
      way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now then, where are the witnesses?&rsquo; said the clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah! that&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; added the Dodger. &lsquo;Where are they? I should like to
      see &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward who
      had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in a
      crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very old
      one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own
      countenance. For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon as
      he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon his
      person a silver snuff-box, with the owner&rsquo;s name engraved upon the lid.
      This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court Guide, and
      being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was his, and that
      he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had disengaged himself
      from the crowd before referred to. He had also remarked a young gentleman
      in the throng, particularly active in making his way about, and that young
      gentleman was the prisoner before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?&rsquo; said the magistrate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with him,&rsquo; 
      replied the Dodger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you anything to say at all?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear his worship ask if you&rsquo;ve anything to say?&rsquo; inquired the
      jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I beg your pardon,&rsquo; said the Dodger, looking up with an air of
      abstraction. &lsquo;Did you redress yourself to me, my man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,&rsquo; observed
      the officer with a grin. &lsquo;Do you mean to say anything, you young shaver?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the Dodger, &lsquo;not here, for this ain&rsquo;t the shop for justice:
      besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning with the Wice
      President of the House of Commons; but I shall have something to say
      elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous and &lsquo;spectable
      circle of acquaintance as&rsquo;ll make them beaks wish they&rsquo;d never been born,
      or that they&rsquo;d got their footmen to hang &lsquo;em up to their own hat-pegs,
      afore they let &lsquo;em come out this morning to try it on upon me. I&rsquo;ll&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There! He&rsquo;s fully committed!&rsquo; interposed the clerk. &lsquo;Take him away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come on,&rsquo; said the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh ah! I&rsquo;ll come on,&rsquo; replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the palm
      of his hand. &lsquo;Ah! (to the Bench) it&rsquo;s no use your looking frightened; I
      won&rsquo;t show you no mercy, not a ha&rsquo;porth of it. <i>You&rsquo;ll</i> pay for this,
      my fine fellers. I wouldn&rsquo;t be you for something! I wouldn&rsquo;t go free, now,
      if you was to fall down on your knees and ask me. Here, carry me off to
      prison! Take me away!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the
      collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary
      business of it; and then grinning in the officer&rsquo;s face, with great glee
      and self-approval.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the best
      of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting here some
      time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had prudently abstained
      from showing himself until he had looked carefully abroad from a snug
      retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not been followed by any
      impertinent person.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news
      that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and
      establishing for himself a glorious reputation.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIV &mdash; THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO
      ROSE MAYLIE. SHE FAILS.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the girl
      Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of the step
      she had taken, wrought upon her mind. She remembered that both the crafty
      Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes, which had been
      hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she was trustworthy
      and beyond the reach of their suspicion. Vile as those schemes were,
      desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were her feelings
      towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and deeper down into
      an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape; still, there were
      times when, even towards him, she felt some relenting, lest her disclosure
      should bring him within the iron grasp he had so long eluded, and he
      should fall at last&mdash;richly as he merited such a fate&mdash;by her
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach
      itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix itself
      steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by any
      consideration. Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful
      inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated
      that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which
      could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a refuge
      from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her&mdash;and what
      more could she do! She was resolved.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they forced
      themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too. She grew
      pale and thin, even within a few days. At times, she took no heed of what
      was passing before her, or no part in conversations where once, she would
      have been the loudest. At other times, she laughed without merriment, and
      was noisy without a moment afterwards&mdash;she sat silent and dejected,
      brooding with her head upon her hands, while the very effort by which she
      roused herself, told, more forcibly than even these indications, that she
      was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were occupied with matters very
      different and distant from those in the course of discussion by her
      companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the hour.
      Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen. The girl looked
      up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened too. Eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An hour this side of midnight,&rsquo; said Sikes, raising the blind to look out
      and returning to his seat. &lsquo;Dark and heavy it is too. A good night for
      business this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; replied Fagin. &lsquo;What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there&rsquo;s none quite
      ready to be done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re right for once,&rsquo; replied Sikes gruffly. &lsquo;It is a pity, for I&rsquo;m in
      the humour too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must make up for lost time when we&rsquo;ve got things into a good train.
      That&rsquo;s all I know,&rsquo; said Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s the way to talk, my dear,&rsquo; replied Fagin, venturing to pat him on
      the shoulder. &lsquo;It does me good to hear you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Does you good, does it!&rsquo; cried Sikes. &lsquo;Well, so be it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this
      concession. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re like yourself to-night, Bill. Quite like yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my
      shoulder, so take it away,&rsquo; said Sikes, casting off the Jew&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It make you nervous, Bill,&mdash;reminds you of being nabbed, does it?&rsquo; 
      said Fagin, determined not to be offended.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,&rsquo; returned Sikes. &lsquo;There never
      was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father, and
      I suppose <i>he</i> is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time,
      unless you came straight from the old &lsquo;un without any father at all
      betwixt you; which I shouldn&rsquo;t wonder at, a bit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin offered no reply to this compliment: but, pulling Sikes by the
      sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of the
      foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hallo!&rsquo; cried Sikes. &lsquo;Nance. Where&rsquo;s the gal going to at this time of
      night?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not far.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What answer&rsquo;s that?&rsquo; retorted Sikes. &lsquo;Do you hear me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know where,&rsquo; replied the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I do,&rsquo; said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because he
      had any real objection to the girl going where she listed. &lsquo;Nowhere. Sit
      down.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;m not well. I told you that before,&rsquo; rejoined the girl. &lsquo;I want a
      breath of air.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Put your head out of the winder,&rsquo; replied Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s not enough there,&rsquo; said the girl. &lsquo;I want it in the street.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you won&rsquo;t have it,&rsquo; replied Sikes. With which assurance he rose,
      locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her head,
      flung it up to the top of an old press. &lsquo;There,&rsquo; said the robber. &lsquo;Now
      stop quietly where you are, will you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,&rsquo; said the girl turning
      very pale. &lsquo;What do you mean, Bill? Do you know what you&rsquo;re doing?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Know what I&rsquo;m&mdash;Oh!&rsquo; cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, &lsquo;she&rsquo;s out of her
      senses, you know, or she daren&rsquo;t talk to me in that way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll drive me on the something desperate,&rsquo; muttered the girl placing
      both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some violent
      outbreak. &lsquo;Let me go, will you,&mdash;this minute&mdash;this instant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; said Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell him to let me go, Fagin. He had better. It&rsquo;ll be better for him. Do
      you hear me?&rsquo; cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear you!&rsquo; repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.
      &lsquo;Aye! And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have such
      a grip on your throat as&rsquo;ll tear some of that screaming voice out. Wot has
      come over you, you jade! Wot is it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go,&rsquo; said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself
      down on the floor, before the door, she said, &lsquo;Bill, let me go; you don&rsquo;t
      know what you are doing. You don&rsquo;t, indeed. For only one hour&mdash;do&mdash;do!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Cut my limbs off one by one!&rsquo; cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the
      arm, &lsquo;If I don&rsquo;t think the gal&rsquo;s stark raving mad. Get up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not till you let me go&mdash;not till you let me go&mdash;Never&mdash;never!&rsquo; 
      screamed the girl. Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his
      opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling and
      wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where he sat
      himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her down by
      force. She struggled and implored by turns until twelve o&rsquo;clock had
      struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest the point any
      further. With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make no more efforts to
      go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at leisure and rejoined
      Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whew!&rsquo; said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face. &lsquo;Wot
      a precious strange gal that is!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may say that, Bill,&rsquo; replied Fagin thoughtfully. &lsquo;You may say that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you think?&rsquo; 
      asked Sikes. &lsquo;Come; you should know her better than me. Wot does it mean?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Obstinacy; woman&rsquo;s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I suppose it is,&rsquo; growled Sikes. &lsquo;I thought I had tamed her, but
      she&rsquo;s as bad as ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Worse,&rsquo; said Fagin thoughtfully. &lsquo;I never knew her like this, for such a
      little cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor I,&rsquo; said Sikes. &lsquo;I think she&rsquo;s got a touch of that fever in her blood
      yet, and it won&rsquo;t come out&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Like enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she&rsquo;s took
      that way again,&rsquo; said Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched on
      my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself
      aloof,&rsquo; said Sikes. &lsquo;We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one way
      or other, it&rsquo;s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here so
      long has made her restless&mdash;eh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s it, my dear,&rsquo; replied the Jew in a whisper. &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her
      former seat. Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and fro;
      tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, now she&rsquo;s on the other tack!&rsquo; exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of
      excessive surprise on his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few
      minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering Sikes
      that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat and bade
      him good-night. He paused when he reached the room-door, and looking
      round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Light him down,&rsquo; said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a pity he
      should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers. Show him a
      light.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle. When they reached
      the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close to the girl,
      said, in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it, Nancy, dear?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean?&rsquo; replied the girl, in the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The reason of all this,&rsquo; replied Fagin. &lsquo;If <i>he</i>&rsquo;&mdash;he pointed
      with his skinny fore-finger up the stairs&mdash;&lsquo;is so hard with you (he&rsquo;s
      a brute, Nance, a brute-beast), why don&rsquo;t you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well?&rsquo; said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching her
      ear, and his eyes looking into hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No matter just now. We&rsquo;ll talk of this again. You have a friend in me,
      Nance; a staunch friend. I have the means at hand, quiet and close. If you
      want revenge on those that treat you like a dog&mdash;like a dog! worse
      than his dog, for he humours him sometimes&mdash;come to me. I say, come
      to me. He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of old, Nance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know you well,&rsquo; replied the girl, without manifesting the least
      emotion. &lsquo;Good-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said
      good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look with
      a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were working
      within his brain. He had conceived the idea&mdash;not from what had just
      passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by degrees&mdash;that
      Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker&rsquo;s brutality, had conceived an
      attachment for some new friend. Her altered manner, her repeated absences
      from home alone, her comparative indifference to the interests of the gang
      for which she had once been so zealous, and, added to these, her desperate
      impatience to leave home that night at a particular hour, all favoured the
      supposition, and rendered it, to him at least, almost matter of certainty.
      The object of this new liking was not among his myrmidons. He would be a
      valuable acquisition with such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin
      argued) be secured without delay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another, and a darker object, to be gained. Sikes knew too much,
      and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the wounds
      were hidden. The girl must know, well, that if she shook him off, she
      could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely wreaked&mdash;to
      the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life&mdash;on the object of
      her more recent fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With a little persuasion,&rsquo; thought Fagin, &lsquo;what more likely than that she
      would consent to poison him? Women have done such things, and worse, to
      secure the same object before now. There would be the dangerous villain:
      the man I hate: gone; another secured in his place; and my influence over
      the girl, with a knowledge of this crime to back it, unlimited.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he
      sat alone, in the housebreaker&rsquo;s room; and with them uppermost in his
      thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of
      sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting. There was
      no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to understand his
      meaning. The girl clearly comprehended it. Her glance at parting showed <i>that</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and
      that was one of the chief ends to be attained. &lsquo;How,&rsquo; thought Fagin, as he
      crept homeward, &lsquo;can I increase my influence with her? What new power can
      I acquire?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such brains are fertile in expedients. If, without extracting a confession
      from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her altered
      regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of whom she
      stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs, could he not
      secure her compliance?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can,&rsquo; said Fagin, almost aloud. &lsquo;She durst not refuse me then. Not for
      her life, not for her life! I have it all. The means are ready, and shall
      be set to work. I shall have you yet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards
      the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way:
      busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he
      wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy crushed
      with every motion of his fingers.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLV &mdash; NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION
    </h2>
    <p>
      The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for the
      appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed
      interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious
      assault on the breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bolter,&rsquo; said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite
      Morris Bolter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, here I am,&rsquo; returned Noah. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the matter? Don&rsquo;t yer ask me to
      do anything till I have done eating. That&rsquo;s a great fault in this place.
      Yer never get time enough over yer meals.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can talk as you eat, can&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Fagin, cursing his dear young
      friend&rsquo;s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, I can talk. I get on better when I talk,&rsquo; said Noah, cutting a
      monstrous slice of bread. &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s Charlotte?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Out,&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;I sent her out this morning with the other young
      woman, because I wanted us to be alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; said Noah. &lsquo;I wish yer&rsquo;d ordered her to make some buttered toast
      first. Well. Talk away. Yer won&rsquo;t interrupt me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he
      had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of
      business.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did well yesterday, my dear,&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;Beautiful! Six shillings
      and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day! The kinchin lay will be a
      fortune to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,&rsquo; said Mr. Bolter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, my dear. The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the
      milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,&rsquo; remarked Mr. Bolter complacently.
      &lsquo;The pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was standing by
      itself outside a public-house. I thought it might get rusty with the rain,
      or catch cold, yer know. Eh? Ha! ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his laugh
      out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk of bread
      and butter, and assisted himself to a second.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I want you, Bolter,&rsquo; said Fagin, leaning over the table, &lsquo;to do a piece
      of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I say,&rsquo; rejoined Bolter, &lsquo;don&rsquo;t yer go shoving me into danger, or sending
      me any more o&rsquo; yer police-offices. That don&rsquo;t suit me, that don&rsquo;t; and so
      I tell yer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s not the smallest danger in it&mdash;not the very smallest,&rsquo; said
      the Jew; &lsquo;it&rsquo;s only to dodge a woman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;An old woman?&rsquo; demanded Mr. Bolter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A young one,&rsquo; replied Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can do that pretty well, I know,&rsquo; said Bolter. &lsquo;I was a regular cunning
      sneak when I was at school. What am I to dodge her for? Not to&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and, if
      possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street, or the
      house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the information you
      can.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;ll yer give me?&rsquo; asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking his
      employer, eagerly, in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you do it well, a pound, my dear. One pound,&rsquo; said Fagin, wishing to
      interest him in the scent as much as possible. &lsquo;And that&rsquo;s what I never
      gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn&rsquo;t valuable consideration to
      be gained.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is she?&rsquo; inquired Noah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh Lor!&rsquo; cried Noah, curling up his nose. &lsquo;Yer doubtful of her, are yer?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they
      are,&rsquo; replied Fagin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; said Noah. &lsquo;Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if they&rsquo;re
      respectable people, eh? Ha! ha! ha! I&rsquo;m your man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I knew you would be,&rsquo; cried Fagin, elated by the success of his proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course, of course,&rsquo; replied Noah. &lsquo;Where is she? Where am I to wait
      for her? Where am I to go?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All that, my dear, you shall hear from me. I&rsquo;ll point her out at the
      proper time,&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and
      equipped in his carter&rsquo;s dress: ready to turn out at a word from Fagin.
      Six nights passed&mdash;six long weary nights&mdash;and on each, Fagin
      came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was not
      yet time. On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an exultation he
      could not conceal. It was Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She goes abroad to-night,&rsquo; said Fagin, &lsquo;and on the right errand, I&rsquo;m
      sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will
      not be back much before daybreak. Come with me. Quick!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of such
      intense excitement that it infected him. They left the house stealthily,
      and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at length before a
      public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in which he had slept, on
      the night of his arrival in London.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was past eleven o&rsquo;clock, and the door was closed. It opened softly on
      its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise; and
      the door was closed behind them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,
      Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of
      glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in the
      adjoining room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is that the woman?&rsquo; he asked, scarcely above his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin nodded yes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t see her face well,&rsquo; whispered Noah. &lsquo;She is looking down, and the
      candle is behind her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay there,&rsquo; whispered Fagin. He signed to Barney, who withdrew. In an
      instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of
      snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking to
      the girl, caused her to raise her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see her now,&rsquo; cried the spy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Plainly?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I should know her among a thousand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out.
      Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and they
      held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place of
      concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hist!&rsquo; cried the lad who held the door. &lsquo;Dow.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To the left,&rsquo; whispered the lad; &lsquo;take the left had, and keep od the
      other side.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl&rsquo;s retreating
      figure, already at some distance before him. He advanced as near as he
      considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the
      better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or
      thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind
      her, pass on. She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to walk
      with a steadier and firmer step. The spy preserved the same relative
      distance between them, and followed: with his eye upon her.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVI &mdash; THE APPOINTMENT KEPT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures
      emerged on London Bridge. One, which advanced with a swift and rapid step,
      was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in quest of
      some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who slunk along
      in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance, accommodated
      his pace to hers: stopping when she stopped: and as she moved again,
      creeping stealthily on: but never allowing himself, in the ardour of his
      pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps. Thus, they crossed the bridge, from
      the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the woman, apparently disappointed
      in her anxious scrutiny of the foot-passengers, turned back. The movement
      was sudden; but he who watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it;
      for, shrinking into one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the
      bridge, and leaning over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he
      suffered her to pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same
      distance in advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and
      followed her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped. The
      man stopped too.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a very dark night. The day had been unfavourable, and at that hour
      and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were, hurried
      quickly past: very possibly without seeing, but certainly without
      noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view. Their
      appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards of such
      of London&rsquo;s destitute population, as chanced to take their way over the
      bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless hovel wherein to
      lay their heads; they stood there in silence: neither speaking nor spoken
      to, by any one who passed.
    </p>
    <p>
      A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that
      burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and rendering
      darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks. The old
      smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull from the
      dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water too black
      to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old Saint Saviour&rsquo;s
      Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the giant-warders of the
      ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the forest of shipping
      below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of churches above, were
      nearly all hidden from sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro&mdash;closely watched
      meanwhile by her hidden observer&mdash;when the heavy bell of St. Paul&rsquo;s
      tolled for the death of another day. Midnight had come upon the crowded
      city. The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse: the chambers
      of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face of the corpse
      and the calm sleep of the child: midnight was upon them all.
    </p>
    <p>
      The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by a
      grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a short
      distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked straight
      towards it. They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement, when the girl
      started, and immediately made towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who
      entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of being
      realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate. They
      halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it immediately; for
      a man in the garments of a countryman came close up&mdash;brushed against
      them, indeed&mdash;at that precise moment.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0203.jpg" alt="0203" width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0203.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not here,&rsquo; said Nancy hurriedly, &lsquo;I am afraid to speak to you here. Come
      away&mdash;out of the public road&mdash;down the steps yonder!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction in
      which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and roughly
      asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the Surrey
      bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour&rsquo;s Church, form a
      landing-stairs from the river. To this spot, the man bearing the
      appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after a moment&rsquo;s
      survey of the place, he began to descend.
    </p>
    <p>
      These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights. Just
      below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the left
      terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames. At this
      point the lower steps widen: so that a person turning that angle of the
      wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs who chance to be
      above him, if only a step. The countryman looked hastily round, when he
      reached this point; and as there seemed no better place of concealment,
      and, the tide being out, there was plenty of room, he slipped aside, with
      his back to the pilaster, and there waited: pretty certain that they would
      come no lower, and that even if he could not hear what was said, he could
      follow them again, with safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the spy
      to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he had
      been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for lost,
      and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or had
      resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious
      conversation. He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place, and
      regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and
      directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely
      breathing, listened attentively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is far enough,&rsquo; said a voice, which was evidently that of the
      gentleman. &lsquo;I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther. Many
      people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but
      you see I am willing to humour you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To humour me!&rsquo; cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re
      considerate, indeed, sir. To humour me! Well, well, it&rsquo;s no matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, for what,&rsquo; said the gentleman in a kinder tone, &lsquo;for what purpose
      can you have brought us to this strange place? Why not have let me speak
      to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something stirring,
      instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I told you before,&rsquo; replied Nancy, &lsquo;that I was afraid to speak to you
      there. I don&rsquo;t know why it is,&rsquo; said the girl, shuddering, &lsquo;but I have
      such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A fear of what?&rsquo; asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I scarcely know of what,&rsquo; replied the girl. &lsquo;I wish I did. Horrible
      thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that has
      made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day. I was reading
      a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things came into the
      print.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Imagination,&rsquo; said the gentleman, soothing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No imagination,&rsquo; replied the girl in a hoarse voice. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll swear I saw
      &ldquo;coffin&rdquo; written in every page of the book in large black letters,&mdash;aye,
      and they carried one close to me, in the streets to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing unusual in that,&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;They have passed
      me often.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Real ones</i>,&rsquo; rejoined the girl. &lsquo;This was not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the
      concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and the
      blood chilled within him. He had never experienced a greater relief than
      in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged her to be calm,
      and not allow herself to become the prey of such fearful fancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak to her kindly,&rsquo; said the young lady to her companion. &lsquo;Poor
      creature! She seems to need it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me as
      I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,&rsquo; cried the girl. &lsquo;Oh,
      dear lady, why ar&rsquo;n&rsquo;t those who claim to be God&rsquo;s own folks as gentle and
      as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth, and beauty, and all
      that they have lost, might be a little proud instead of so much humbler?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;A Turk turns his face, after washing it well,
      to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after giving
      their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles off, turn
      with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven. Between the
      Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were perhaps
      uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover herself. The
      gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were not here last Sunday night,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I couldn&rsquo;t come,&rsquo; replied Nancy; &lsquo;I was kept by force.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By whom?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Him that I told the young lady of before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on the
      subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?&rsquo; asked the old
      gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the girl, shaking her head. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not very easy for me to
      leave him unless he knows why; I couldn&rsquo;t give him a drink of laudanum
      before I came away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did he awake before you returned?&rsquo; inquired the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good,&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;Now listen to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ready,&rsquo; replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This young lady,&rsquo; the gentleman began, &lsquo;has communicated to me, and to
      some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly a
      fortnight since. I confess to you that I had doubts, at first, whether you
      were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am,&rsquo; said the girl earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I repeat that I firmly believe it. To prove to you that I am disposed to
      trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the
      secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks. But if&mdash;if&mdash;&rsquo; 
      said the gentleman, &lsquo;he cannot be secured, or, if secured, cannot be acted
      upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fagin,&rsquo; cried the girl, recoiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That man must be delivered up by you,&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not do it! I will never do it!&rsquo; replied the girl. &lsquo;Devil that he
      is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not?&rsquo; said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this
      answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never!&rsquo; returned the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For one reason,&rsquo; rejoined the girl firmly, &lsquo;for one reason, that the lady
      knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her promise:
      and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has led, I have
      led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the same courses
      together, and I&rsquo;ll not turn upon them, who might&mdash;any of them&mdash;have
      turned upon me, but didn&rsquo;t, bad as they are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he had
      been aiming to attain; &lsquo;put Monks into my hands, and leave him to me to
      deal with.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if he turns against the others?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him, there
      the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver&rsquo;s little
      history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye, and if
      the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And if it is not?&rsquo; suggested the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; pursued the gentleman, &lsquo;this Fagin shall not be brought to justice
      without your consent. In such a case I could show you reasons, I think,
      which would induce you to yield it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have I the lady&rsquo;s promise for that?&rsquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have,&rsquo; replied Rose. &lsquo;My true and faithful pledge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?&rsquo; said the girl, after a
      short pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; replied the gentleman. &lsquo;The intelligence should be brought to
      bear upon him, that he could never even guess.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,&rsquo; said the girl
      after another interval of silence, &lsquo;but I will take your words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so, she
      proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the listener
      to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by name and
      situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that night. From
      the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared as if the
      gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she
      communicated. When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the
      place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting
      observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the habit
      of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for the
      purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to her
      recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is tall,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;and a strongly made man, but not stout; he
      has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his shoulder,
      first on one side, and then on the other. Don&rsquo;t forget that, for his eyes
      are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man&rsquo;s, that you might
      almost tell him by that alone. His face is dark, like his hair and eyes;
      and, although he can&rsquo;t be more than six or eight and twenty, withered and
      haggard. His lips are often discoloured and disfigured with the marks of
      teeth; for he has desperate fits, and sometimes even bites his hands and
      covers them with wounds&mdash;why did you start?&rsquo; said the girl, stopping
      suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious of
      having done so, and begged her to proceed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Part of this,&rsquo; said the girl, &lsquo;I have drawn out from other people at the
      house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times he was
      covered up in a large cloak. I think that&rsquo;s all I can give you to know him
      by. Stay though,&rsquo; she added. &lsquo;Upon his throat: so high that you can see a
      part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his face: there is&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?&rsquo; cried the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How&rsquo;s this?&rsquo; said the girl. &lsquo;You know him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they were
      so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think I do,&rsquo; said the gentleman, breaking silence. &lsquo;I should by your
      description. We shall see. Many people are singularly like each other. It
      may not be the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he took
      a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell from the
      distinctness with which he heard him mutter, &lsquo;It must be he!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; he said, returning: so it seemed by the sound: to the spot where he
      had stood before, &lsquo;you have given us most valuable assistance, young
      woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to serve
      you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Nancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will not persist in saying that,&rsquo; rejoined the gentleman, with a
      voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder and
      more obdurate heart. &lsquo;Think now. Tell me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing, sir,&rsquo; rejoined the girl, weeping. &lsquo;You can do nothing to help
      me. I am past all hope, indeed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You put yourself beyond its pale,&rsquo; said the gentleman. &lsquo;The past has been
      a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such
      priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never
      grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it is
      in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must come as
      you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you fear to
      remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the compass of
      our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before the dawn of
      morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of day-light, you
      shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your former associates,
      and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind you, as if you were to
      disappear from the earth this moment. Come! I would not have you go back
      to exchange one word with any old companion, or take one look at any old
      haunt, or breathe the very air which is pestilence and death to you. Quit
      them all, while there is time and opportunity!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She will be persuaded now,&rsquo; cried the young lady. &lsquo;She hesitates, I am
      sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I fear not, my dear,&rsquo; said the gentleman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No sir, I do not,&rsquo; replied the girl, after a short struggle. &lsquo;I am
      chained to my old life. I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave it. I
      must have gone too far to turn back,&mdash;and yet I don&rsquo;t know, for if
      you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it off.
      But,&rsquo; she said, looking hastily round, &lsquo;this fear comes over me again. I
      must go home.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Home!&rsquo; repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Home, lady,&rsquo; rejoined the girl. &lsquo;To such a home as I have raised for
      myself with the work of my whole life. Let us part. I shall be watched or
      seen. Go! Go! If I have done you any service all I ask is, that you leave
      me, and let me go my way alone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is useless,&rsquo; said the gentleman, with a sigh. &lsquo;We compromise her
      safety, perhaps, by staying here. We may have detained her longer than she
      expected already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; urged the girl. &lsquo;You have.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What,&rsquo; cried the young lady, &lsquo;can be the end of this poor creature&rsquo;s
      life!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; repeated the girl. &lsquo;Look before you, lady. Look at that dark
      water. How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the tide,
      and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them. It may be years
      hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at last.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do not speak thus, pray,&rsquo; returned the young lady, sobbing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors
      should!&rsquo; replied the girl. &lsquo;Good-night, good-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This purse,&rsquo; cried the young lady. &lsquo;Take it for my sake, that you may
      have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No!&rsquo; replied the girl. &lsquo;I have not done this for money. Let me have that
      to think of. And yet&mdash;give me something that you have worn: I should
      like to have something&mdash;no, no, not a ring&mdash;your gloves or
      handkerchief&mdash;anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you,
      sweet lady. There. Bless you! God bless you. Good-night, good-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some discovery
      which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to determine the
      gentleman to leave her, as she requested.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards
      appeared upon the bridge. They stopped at the summit of the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hark!&rsquo; cried the young lady, listening. &lsquo;Did she call! I thought I heard
      her voice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, my love,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. &lsquo;She has not
      moved, and will not till we are gone.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his, and
      led her, with gentle force, away. As they disappeared, the girl sunk down
      nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and vented the
      anguish of her heart in bitter tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended the
      street. The astonished listener remained motionless on his post for some
      minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious glances
      round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his hiding-place,
      and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in the same manner
      as he had descended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that he
      was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and made
      for the Jew&rsquo;s house as fast as his legs would carry him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVII &mdash; FATAL CONSEQUENCES
    </h2>
    <p>
      It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn of
      the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets are
      silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and profligacy
      and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still and silent
      hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so distorted and
      pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less like a man, than
      like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and worried by an evil
      spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet, with
      his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table by his
      side. His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed in thought,
      he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his toothless gums a few
      such fangs as should have been a dog&rsquo;s or rat&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.
      Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and
      then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt wick
      drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon the
      table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      Indeed they were. Mortification at the overthrow of his notable scheme;
      hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and utter
      distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter
      disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of detection,
      and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by all; these
      were the passionate considerations which, following close upon each other
      with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain of Fagin, as every
      evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take
      the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted by a
      footstep in the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At last,&rsquo; he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. &lsquo;At last!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The bell rang gently as he spoke. He crept upstairs to the door, and
      presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who carried a
      bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his outer coat, the
      man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There!&rsquo; he said, laying the bundle on the table. &lsquo;Take care of that, and
      do the most you can with it. It&rsquo;s been trouble enough to get; I thought I
      should have been here, three hours ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard, sat
      down again without speaking. But he did not take his eyes off the robber,
      for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over against
      each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his lips
      quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions which had
      mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back his chair, and
      surveyed him with a look of real affright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot now?&rsquo; cried Sikes. &lsquo;Wot do you look at a man so for?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the
      air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the
      moment gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damme!&rsquo; said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      gone mad. I must look to myself here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; rejoined Fagin, finding his voice. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not&mdash;you&rsquo;re not
      the person, Bill. I&rsquo;ve no&mdash;no fault to find with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, you haven&rsquo;t, haven&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and
      ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s
      lucky&mdash;for one of us. Which one that is, don&rsquo;t matter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got that to tell you, Bill,&rsquo; said Fagin, drawing his chair nearer,
      &lsquo;will make you worse than me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Aye?&rsquo; returned the robber with an incredulous air. &lsquo;Tell away! Look
      sharp, or Nance will think I&rsquo;m lost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lost!&rsquo; cried Fagin. &lsquo;She has pretty well settled that, in her own mind,
      already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew&rsquo;s face, and
      reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched his coat
      collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Speak, will you!&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;or if you don&rsquo;t, it shall be for want of
      breath. Open your mouth and say wot you&rsquo;ve got to say in plain words. Out
      with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose that lad that&rsquo;s laying there&mdash;&rsquo; Fagin began.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not previously
      observed him. &lsquo;Well!&rsquo; he said, resuming his former position.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Suppose that lad,&rsquo; pursued Fagin, &lsquo;was to peach&mdash;to blow upon us all&mdash;first
      seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having a meeting
      with &lsquo;em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe every mark that
      they might know us by, and the crib where we might be most easily taken.
      Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow upon a plant we&rsquo;ve all
      been in, more or less&mdash;of his own fancy; not grabbed, trapped, tried,
      earwigged by the parson and brought to it on bread and water,&mdash;but of
      his own fancy; to please his own taste; stealing out at nights to find
      those most interested against us, and peaching to them. Do you hear me?&rsquo; 
      cried the Jew, his eyes flashing with rage. &lsquo;Suppose he did all this, what
      then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What then!&rsquo; replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath. &lsquo;If he was left alive
      till I came, I&rsquo;d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot into as
      many grains as there are hairs upon his head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What if I did it!&rsquo; cried Fagin almost in a yell. &lsquo;I, that knows so much,
      and could hang so many besides myself!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rsquo; replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at
      the mere suggestion. &lsquo;I&rsquo;d do something in the jail that &lsquo;ud get me put in
      irons; and if I was tried along with you, I&rsquo;d fall upon you with them in
      the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I should have
      such strength,&rsquo; muttered the robber, poising his brawny arm, &lsquo;that I could
      smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You would?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would I!&rsquo; said the housebreaker. &lsquo;Try me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care who,&rsquo; replied Sikes impatiently. &lsquo;Whoever it was, I&rsquo;d serve
      them the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent, stooped
      over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse him. Sikes
      leant forward in his chair: looking on with his hands upon his knees, as
      if wondering much what all this questioning and preparation was to end in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bolter, Bolter! Poor lad!&rsquo; said Fagin, looking up with an expression of
      devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s
      tired&mdash;tired with watching for her so long,&mdash;watching for <i>her</i>,
      Bill.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot d&rsquo;ye mean?&rsquo; asked Sikes, drawing back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him into
      a sitting posture. When his assumed name had been repeated several times,
      Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked sleepily about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell me that again&mdash;once again, just for him to hear,&rsquo; said the Jew,
      pointing to Sikes as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell yer what?&rsquo; asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That about&mdash; <i>Nancy</i>,&rsquo; said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the
      wrist, as if to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough.
      &lsquo;You followed her?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To London Bridge?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where she met two people.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So she did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before, who
      asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she did&mdash;and
      to describe him, which she did&mdash;and to tell her what house it was
      that we meet at, and go to, which she did&mdash;and where it could be best
      watched from, which she did&mdash;and what time the people went there,
      which she did. She did all this. She told it all every word without a
      threat, without a murmur&mdash;she did&mdash;did she not?&rsquo; cried Fagin,
      half mad with fury.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; replied Noah, scratching his head. &lsquo;That&rsquo;s just what it was!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did they say, about last Sunday?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About last Sunday!&rsquo; replied Noah, considering. &lsquo;Why I told yer that
      before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Again. Tell it again!&rsquo; cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes, and
      brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They asked her,&rsquo; said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to have
      a dawning perception who Sikes was, &lsquo;they asked her why she didn&rsquo;t come,
      last Sunday, as she promised. She said she couldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why&mdash;why? Tell him that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told them
      of before,&rsquo; replied Noah.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What more of him?&rsquo; cried Fagin. &lsquo;What more of the man she had told them
      of before? Tell him that, tell him that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, that she couldn&rsquo;t very easily get out of doors unless he knew where
      she was going to,&rsquo; said Noah; &lsquo;and so the first time she went to see the
      lady, she&mdash;ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that it did&mdash;she
      gave him a drink of laudanum.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hell&rsquo;s fire!&rsquo; cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew. &lsquo;Let me go!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted, wildly
      and furiously, up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bill, Bill!&rsquo; cried Fagin, following him hastily. &lsquo;A word. Only a word.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was
      unable to open the door: on which he was expending fruitless oaths and
      violence, when the Jew came panting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me out,&rsquo; said Sikes. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t speak to me; it&rsquo;s not safe. Let me out, I
      say!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear me speak a word,&rsquo; rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t be&mdash;too&mdash;violent, Bill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see each
      other&rsquo;s faces. They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire in the
      eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean,&rsquo; said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now useless,
      &lsquo;not too violent for safety. Be crafty, Bill, and not too bold.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had turned
      the lock, dashed into the silent streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without one pause, or moment&rsquo;s consideration; without once turning his
      head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering
      them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage
      resolution: his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw seemed
      starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong course, nor
      muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his own door. He
      opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the stairs; and entering
      his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting a heavy table against
      it, drew back the curtain of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it. He had roused her from her
      sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get up!&rsquo; said the man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is you, Bill!&rsquo; said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his
      return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;Get up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the
      candlestick, and hurled it under the grate. Seeing the faint light of
      early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let it be,&rsquo; said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s enough
      light for wot I&rsquo;ve got to do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bill,&rsquo; said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, &lsquo;why do you look like
      that at me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils and
      heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat, dragged her
      into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the door, placed his
      heavy hand upon her mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bill, Bill!&rsquo; gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal fear,&mdash;&lsquo;I&mdash;I
      won&rsquo;t scream or cry&mdash;not once&mdash;hear me&mdash;speak to me&mdash;tell
      me what I have done!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You know, you she devil!&rsquo; returned the robber, suppressing his breath.
      &lsquo;You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,&rsquo; rejoined
      the girl, clinging to him. &lsquo;Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have the heart to
      kill me. Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one night, for you.
      You <i>shall</i> have time to think, and save yourself this crime; I will
      not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off. Bill, Bill, for dear God&rsquo;s
      sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my blood! I have been
      true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl
      were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear them
      away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bill,&rsquo; cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, &lsquo;the
      gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some foreign
      country where I could end my days in solitude and peace. Let me see them
      again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy and goodness to
      you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far apart lead better
      lives, and forget how we have lived, except in prayers, and never see each
      other more. It is never too late to repent. They told me so&mdash;I feel
      it now&mdash;but we must have time&mdash;a little, little time!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty of
      immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the midst
      of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could summon, upon
      the upturned face that almost touched his own.
    </p>
    <p>
      She staggered and fell: nearly blinded with the blood that rained down
      from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty, on
      her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief&mdash;Rose Maylie&rsquo;s
      own&mdash;and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven
      as her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her
      Maker.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a ghastly figure to look upon. The murderer staggering backward to
      the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy club
      and struck her down.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLVIII &mdash; THE FLIGHT OF SIKES
    </h2>
    <p>
      Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed
      within wide London&rsquo;s bounds since night hung over it, that was the worst.
      Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning air, that
      was the foulest and most cruel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun&mdash;the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new
      life, and hope, and freshness to man&mdash;burst upon the crowded city in
      clear and radiant glory. Through costly-coloured glass and paper-mended
      window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed its equal ray.
      It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay. It did. He tried to
      shut it out, but it would stream in. If the sight had been a ghastly one
      in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all that brilliant light!
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir. There had been a moan and
      motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck and
      struck again. Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to fancy the
      eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them glaring
      upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that quivered
      and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling. He had plucked it off again.
      And there was the body&mdash;mere flesh and blood, no more&mdash;but such
      flesh, and so much blood!
    </p>
    <p>
      He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There was
      hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder, and,
      caught by the air, whirled up the chimney. Even that frightened him,
      sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then piled it
      on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes. He washed himself, and
      rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be removed, but he cut
      the pieces out, and burnt them. How those stains were dispersed about the
      room! The very feet of the dog were bloody.
    </p>
    <p>
      All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no, not
      for a moment. Such preparations completed, he moved, backward, towards the
      door: dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his feet anew and
      carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He shut the door
      softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing was
      visible from the outside. There was the curtain still drawn, which she
      would have opened to admit the light she never saw again. It lay nearly
      under there. <i>He</i> knew that. God, how the sun poured down upon the
      very spot!
    </p>
    <p>
      The glance was instantaneous. It was a relief to have got free of the
      room. He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.
    </p>

      <a href="images/0214.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which stands
      the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate Hill, unsteady
      of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the right again,
      almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the foot-path across
      the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on Hampstead Heath. Traversing
      the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he mounted the opposite bank, and
      crossing the road which joins the villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made
      along the remaining portion of the heath to the fields at North End, in
      one of which he laid himself down under a hedge, and slept.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon he was up again, and away,&mdash;not far into the country, but back
      towards London by the high-road&mdash;then back again&mdash;then over
      another part of the same ground as he already traversed&mdash;then
      wandering up and down in fields, and lying on ditches&rsquo; brinks to rest, and
      starting up to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat and
      drink? Hendon. That was a good place, not far off, and out of most
      people&rsquo;s way. Thither he directed his steps,&mdash;running sometimes, and
      sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail&rsquo;s pace, or
      stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick. But when he
      got there, all the people he met&mdash;the very children at the doors&mdash;seemed
      to view him with suspicion. Back he turned again, without the courage to
      purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no food for many hours; and
      once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain where to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the old
      place. Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane, and still
      he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round, and still
      lingered about the same spot. At last he got away, and shaped his course
      for Hatfield.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nine o&rsquo;clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the dog,
      limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the hill by
      the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little street,
      crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided them to the
      spot. There was a fire in the tap-room, and some country-labourers were
      drinking before it.
    </p>
    <p>
      They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest corner,
      and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog: to whom he cast a morsel
      of food from time to time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the neighbouring
      land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted, upon the age of
      some old man who had been buried on the previous Sunday; the young men
      present considering him very old, and the old men present declaring him to
      have been quite young&mdash;not older, one white-haired grandfather said,
      than he was&mdash;with ten or fifteen year of life in him at least&mdash;if
      he had taken care; if he had taken care.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The
      robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his
      corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the
      noisy entrance of a new comer.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who travelled
      about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors, wash-balls,
      harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap perfumery, cosmetics,
      and such-like wares, which he carried in a case slung to his back. His
      entrance was the signal for various homely jokes with the countrymen,
      which slackened not until he had made his supper, and opened his box of
      treasures, when he ingeniously contrived to unite business with amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what be that stoof? Good to eat, Harry?&rsquo; asked a grinning countryman,
      pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the fellow, producing one, &lsquo;this is the infallible and
      invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt,
      mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen, cambric,
      cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or woollen stuff.
      Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains,
      pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with the infallible and
      invaluable composition. If a lady stains her honour, she has only need to
      swallow one cake and she&rsquo;s cured at once&mdash;for it&rsquo;s poison. If a
      gentleman wants to prove this, he has only need to bolt one little square,
      and he has put it beyond question&mdash;for it&rsquo;s quite as satisfactory as
      a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier in the flavour, consequently the
      more credit in taking it. One penny a square. With all these virtues, one
      penny a square!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly
      hesitated. The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all bought up as fast as it can be made,&rsquo; said the fellow. &lsquo;There
      are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery,
      always a-working upon it, and they can&rsquo;t make it fast enough, though the
      men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned directly,
      with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a premium of fifty
      for twins. One penny a square! Two half-pence is all the same, and four
      farthings is received with joy. One penny a square! Wine-stains,
      fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains, pitch-stains,
      mud-stains, blood-stains! Here is a stain upon the hat of a gentleman in
      company, that I&rsquo;ll take clean out, before he can order me a pint of ale.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hah!&rsquo; cried Sikes starting up. &lsquo;Give that back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll take it clean out, sir,&rsquo; replied the man, winking to the company,
      &lsquo;before you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe the
      dark stain upon this gentleman&rsquo;s hat, no wider than a shilling, but
      thicker than a half-crown. Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain,
      beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or
      blood-stain&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew the
      table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened
      upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was not
      followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken sullen
      fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of the lamps
      of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking past, when
      he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was standing at the
      little post-office. He almost knew what was to come; but he crossed over,
      and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man,
      dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a
      basket which lay ready on the pavement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s for your people,&rsquo; said the guard. &lsquo;Now, look alive in there, will
      you. Damn that &lsquo;ere bag, it warn&rsquo;t ready night afore last; this won&rsquo;t do,
      you know!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything new up in town, Ben?&rsquo; asked the game-keeper, drawing back to the
      window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, nothing that I knows on,&rsquo; replied the man, pulling on his gloves.
      &lsquo;Corn&rsquo;s up a little. I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields way,
      but I don&rsquo;t reckon much upon it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, that&rsquo;s quite true,&rsquo; said a gentleman inside, who was looking out of
      the window. &lsquo;And a dreadful murder it was.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Was it, sir?&rsquo; rejoined the guard, touching his hat. &lsquo;Man or woman, pray,
      sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A woman,&rsquo; replied the gentleman. &lsquo;It is supposed&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, Ben,&rsquo; replied the coachman impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn that &lsquo;ere bag,&rsquo; said the guard; &lsquo;are you gone to sleep in there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coming!&rsquo; cried the office keeper, running out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Coming,&rsquo; growled the guard. &lsquo;Ah, and so&rsquo;s the young &lsquo;ooman of property
      that&rsquo;s going to take a fancy to me, but I don&rsquo;t know when. Here, give
      hold. All ri&mdash;ight!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he had
      just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where to go.
      At length he went back again, and took the road which leads from Hatfield
      to St. Albans.
    </p>
    <p>
      He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged into
      the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe creeping
      upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him, substance
      or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some fearful thing; but
      these fears were nothing compared to the sense that haunted him of that
      morning&rsquo;s ghastly figure following at his heels. He could trace its shadow
      in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the outline, and note how stiff
      and solemn it seemed to stalk along. He could hear its garments rustling
      in the leaves, and every breath of wind came laden with that last low cry.
      If he stopped it did the same. If he ran, it followed&mdash;not running
      too: that would have been a relief: but like a corpse endowed with the
      mere machinery of life, and borne on one slow melancholy wind that never
      rose or fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat this
      phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on his
      head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was behind
      him then. He had kept it before him that morning, but it was behind now&mdash;always.
      He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that it stood above him,
      visibly out against the cold night-sky. He threw himself upon the road&mdash;on
      his back upon the road. At his head it stood, silent, erect, and still&mdash;a
      living grave-stone, with its epitaph in blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence
      must sleep. There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long minute
      of that agony of fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the night.
      Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it very dark
      within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail. He <i>could
      not</i> walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched himself
      close to the wall&mdash;to undergo new torture.
    </p>
    <p>
      For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than that
      from which he had escaped. Those widely staring eyes, so lustreless and so
      glassy, that he had better borne to see them than think upon them,
      appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in themselves, but giving
      light to nothing. There were but two, but they were everywhere. If he shut
      out the sight, there came the room with every well-known object&mdash;some,
      indeed, that he would have forgotten, if he had gone over its contents
      from memory&mdash;each in its accustomed place. The body was in <i>its</i>
      place, and its eyes were as he saw them when he stole away. He got up, and
      rushed into the field without. The figure was behind him. He re-entered
      the shed, and shrunk down once more. The eyes were there, before he had
      laid himself along.
    </p>
    <p>
      And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling in
      every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when suddenly
      there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting, and the
      roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder. Any sound of men in that
      lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm, was something
      to him. He regained his strength and energy at the prospect of personal
      danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the open air.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broad sky seemed on fire. Rising into the air with showers of sparks,
      and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting the
      atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the direction
      where he stood. The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled the roar, and
      he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing of an alarm-bell,
      the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames as they twined round
      some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though refreshed by food. The noise
      increased as he looked. There were people there&mdash;men and women&mdash;light,
      bustle. It was like new life to him. He darted onward&mdash;straight,
      headlong&mdash;dashing through brier and brake, and leaping gate and fence
      as madly as his dog, who careered with loud and sounding bark before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He came upon the spot. There were half-dressed figures tearing to and fro,
      some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables, others
      driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others coming laden
      from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks, and the tumbling
      down of red-hot beams. The apertures, where doors and windows stood an
      hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls rocked and crumbled into
      the burning well; the molten lead and iron poured down, white hot, upon
      the ground. Women and children shrieked, and men encouraged each other
      with noisy shouts and cheers. The clanking of the engine-pumps, and the
      spurting and hissing of the water as it fell upon the blazing wood, added
      to the tremendous roar. He shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying
      from memory and himself, plunged into the thickest of the throng. Hither
      and thither he dived that night: now working at the pumps, and now
      hurrying through the smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself
      wherever noise and men were thickest. Up and down the ladders, upon the
      roofs of buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight,
      under the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great
      fire was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor
      bruise, nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only
      smoke and blackened ruins remained.
    </p>
    <p>
      This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the
      dreadful consciousness of his crime. He looked suspiciously about him, for
      the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject of
      their talk. The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and they
      drew off, stealthily, together. He passed near an engine where some men
      were seated, and they called to him to share in their refreshment. He took
      some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of beer, heard the firemen,
      who were from London, talking about the murder. &lsquo;He has gone to
      Birmingham, they say,&rsquo; said one: &lsquo;but they&rsquo;ll have him yet, for the scouts
      are out, and by to-morrow night there&rsquo;ll be a cry all through the
      country.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then
      lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep. He
      wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the fear
      of another solitary night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s somebody to speak to there, at all event,&rsquo; he thought. &lsquo;A good
      hiding-place, too. They&rsquo;ll never expect to nab me there, after this
      country scent. Why can&rsquo;t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt
      from Fagin, get abroad to France? Damme, I&rsquo;ll risk it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least
      frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed within
      a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by a
      circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had
      fixed on for his destination.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog, though. If any description of him were out, it would not be
      forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him. This
      might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets. He resolved
      to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond: picking up a heavy
      stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal looked up into his master&rsquo;s face while these preparations were
      making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their purpose, or
      the robber&rsquo;s sidelong look at him was sterner than ordinary, he skulked a
      little farther in the rear than usual, and cowered as he came more slowly
      along. When his master halted at the brink of a pool, and looked round to
      call him, he stopped outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you hear me call? Come here!&rsquo; cried Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped to
      attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and started
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come back!&rsquo; said the robber.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog wagged his tail, but moved not. Sikes made a running noose and
      called him again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his
      hardest speed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the
      expectation that he would return. But no dog appeared, and at length he
      resumed his journey.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XLIX &mdash; MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET. THEIR
      CONVERSATION, AND THE INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT
    </h2>
    <p>
      The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow alighted from a
      hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly. The door being opened,
      a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed himself on one side of the
      steps, while another man, who had been seated on the box, dismounted too,
      and stood upon the other side. At a sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped
      out a third man, and taking him between them, hurried him into the house.
      This man was Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.
      Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of
      this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance, stopped.
      The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He knows the alternative,&rsquo; said Mr. Browlow. &lsquo;If he hesitates or moves a
      finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for the aid of
      the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How dare you say this of me?&rsquo; asked Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How dare you urge me to it, young man?&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, confronting
      him with a steady look. &lsquo;Are you mad enough to leave this house? Unhand
      him. There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow. But I warn you, by
      all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant will have you
      apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery. I am resolute and
      immoveable. If you are determined to be the same, your blood be upon your
      own head!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by these
      dogs?&rsquo; asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who stood
      beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By mine,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;Those persons are indemnified by me. If
      you complain of being deprived of your liberty&mdash;you had power and
      opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it advisable
      to remain quiet&mdash;I say again, throw yourself for protection on the
      law. I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too far to
      recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have passed
      into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf into which
      you rushed, yourself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides. He hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will decide quickly,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and
      composure. &lsquo;If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign you
      to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a shudder,
      foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the way. If not,
      and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those you have deeply
      injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair. It has waited for
      you two whole days.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be prompt,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;A word from me, and the
      alternative has gone for ever.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Still the man hesitated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have not the inclination to parley,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;and, as I
      advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there&mdash;&rsquo; demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,&mdash;&lsquo;is there&mdash;no
      middle course?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in
      his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the
      room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lock the door on the outside,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants, &lsquo;and
      come when I ring.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is pretty treatment, sir,&rsquo; said Monks, throwing down his hat and
      cloak, &lsquo;from my father&rsquo;s oldest friend.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is because I was your father&rsquo;s oldest friend, young man,&rsquo; returned Mr.
      Brownlow; &lsquo;it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy years
      were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and kindred
      who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary, lonely man: it
      is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters&rsquo; death-bed when he was
      yet a boy, on the morning that would&mdash;but Heaven willed otherwise&mdash;have
      made her my young wife; it is because my seared heart clung to him, from
      that time forth, through all his trials and errors, till he died; it is
      because old recollections and associations filled my heart, and even the
      sight of you brings with it old thoughts of him; it is because of all
      these things that I am moved to treat you gently now&mdash;yes, Edward
      Leeford, even now&mdash;and blush for your unworthiness who bear the
      name.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What has the name to do with it?&rsquo; asked the other, after contemplating,
      half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the agitation of his
      companion. &lsquo;What is the name to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;nothing to you. But it was <i>hers</i>,
      and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the glow
      and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a stranger. I am
      very glad you have changed it&mdash;very&mdash;very.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is all mighty fine,&rsquo; said Monks (to retain his assumed designation)
      after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself in sullen
      defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his face with his
      hand. &lsquo;But what do you want with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself: &lsquo;a brother, the
      whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the street,
      was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither, in wonder
      and alarm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no brother,&rsquo; replied Monks. &lsquo;You know I was an only child. Why do
      you talk to me of brothers? You know that, as well as I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Attend to what I do know, and you may not,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;I shall
      interest you by and by. I know that of the wretched marriage, into which
      family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all ambition, forced
      your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole and most unnatural
      issue.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t care for hard names,&rsquo; interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.
      &lsquo;You know the fact, and that&rsquo;s enough for me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I also know,&rsquo; pursued the old gentleman, &lsquo;the misery, the slow
      torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how
      listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their heavy
      chain through a world that was poisoned to them both. I know how cold
      formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave place to
      dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last they
      wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space apart,
      carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death could break
      the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest looks they could
      assume. Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon. But it rusted and
      cankered at your father&rsquo;s heart for years.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, they were separated,&rsquo; said Monks, &lsquo;and what of that?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When they had been separated for some time,&rsquo; returned Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;and
      your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had utterly
      forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who, with prospects
      blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new friends. This
      circumstance, at least, you know already.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon the
      ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. &lsquo;Not I.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never
      forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,&rsquo; returned Mr.
      Brownlow. &lsquo;I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than
      eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty&mdash;for he was, I
      repeat, a boy, when <i>his</i> father ordered him to marry. Must I go back
      to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will you
      spare it, and disclose to me the truth?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have nothing to disclose,&rsquo; rejoined Monks. &lsquo;You must talk on if you
      will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;These new friends, then,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;were a naval officer
      retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year before,
      and left him with two children&mdash;there had been more, but, of all
      their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters; one a
      beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two or three
      years old.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s this to me?&rsquo; asked Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They resided,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the
      interruption, &lsquo;in a part of the country to which your father in his
      wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode. Acquaintance,
      intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your father was gifted
      as few men are. He had his sister&rsquo;s soul and person. As the old officer
      knew him more and more, he grew to love him. I would that it had ended
      there. His daughter did the same.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes fixed
      upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that
      daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a
      guileless girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your tale is of the longest,&rsquo; observed Monks, moving restlessly in his
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,&rsquo; returned
      Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed joy
      and happiness, it would be very brief. At length one of those rich
      relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had been
      sacrificed, as others are often&mdash;it is no uncommon case&mdash;died,
      and to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him
      his panacea for all griefs&mdash;Money. It was necessary that he should
      immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and
      where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion. He went; was
      seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the
      intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he
      died the day after her arrival, leaving no will&mdash;<i>no will</i>&mdash;so
      that the whole property fell to her and you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a
      face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards the
      speaker. As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the air of
      one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face and hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,&rsquo; said
      Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other&rsquo;s face, &lsquo;he came
      to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never heard of that,&rsquo; interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear
      incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture&mdash;a
      portrait painted by himself&mdash;a likeness of this poor girl&mdash;which
      he did not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty
      journey. He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked in
      a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself; confided
      to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any loss, into
      money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of his recent
      acquisition, to fly the country&mdash;I guessed too well he would not fly
      alone&mdash;and never see it more. Even from me, his old and early friend,
      whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that covered one most
      dear to both&mdash;even from me he withheld any more particular
      confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after that to see me
      once again, for the last time on earth. Alas! <i>That</i> was the last
      time. I had no letter, and I never saw him more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I went,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, &lsquo;I went, when all was
      over, to the scene of his&mdash;I will use the term the world would freely
      use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him&mdash;of his
      guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child
      should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her. The
      family had left that part a week before; they had called in such trifling
      debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place by night.
      Why, or whither, none can tell.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of
      triumph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When your brother,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other&rsquo;s
      chair, &lsquo;When your brother: a feeble, ragged, neglected child: was cast in
      my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a life of
      vice and infamy&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What?&rsquo; cried Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;By me,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;I told you I should interest you before long.
      I say by me&mdash;I see that your cunning associate suppressed my name,
      although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your ears. When
      he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from sickness in my house,
      his strong resemblance to this picture I have spoken of, struck me with
      astonishment. Even when I first saw him in all his dirt and misery, there
      was a lingering expression in his face that came upon me like a glimpse of
      some old friend flashing on one in a vivid dream. I need not tell you he
      was snared away before I knew his history&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; asked Monks hastily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you know it well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Denial to me is vain,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;I shall show you that I
      know more than that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;can&rsquo;t prove anything against me,&rsquo; stammered Monks. &lsquo;I
      defy you to do it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall see,&rsquo; returned the old gentleman with a searching glance. &lsquo;I
      lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him. Your mother being
      dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody could, and
      as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate in the West
      Indies&mdash;whither, as you well know, you retired upon your mother&rsquo;s
      death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here&mdash;I made the
      voyage. You had left it, months before, and were supposed to be in London,
      but no one could tell where. I returned. Your agents had no clue to your
      residence. You came and went, they said, as strangely as you had ever
      done: sometimes for days together and sometimes not for months: keeping to
      all appearance the same low haunts and mingling with the same infamous
      herd who had been your associates when a fierce ungovernable boy. I
      wearied them with new applications. I paced the streets by night and day,
      but until two hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw
      you for an instant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now you do see me,&rsquo; said Monks, rising boldly, &lsquo;what then? Fraud and
      robbery are high-sounding words&mdash;justified, you think, by a fancied
      resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man&rsquo;s Brother! You
      don&rsquo;t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you don&rsquo;t even
      know that.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I <i>did not</i>,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; &lsquo;but within the last
      fortnight I have learnt it all. You have a brother; you know it, and him.
      There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret and the
      gain to you at her own death. It contained a reference to some child
      likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was born, and
      accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were first awakened
      by his resemblance to your father. You repaired to the place of his birth.
      There existed proofs&mdash;proofs long suppressed&mdash;of his birth and
      parentage. Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now, in your own words
      to your accomplice the Jew, &ldquo;<i>the only proofs of the boy&rsquo;s identity lie
      at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that received them from the
      mother is rotting in her coffin</i>.&rdquo; Unworthy son, coward, liar,&mdash;you,
      who hold your councils with thieves and murderers in dark rooms at night,&mdash;you,
      whose plots and wiles have brought a violent death upon the head of one
      worth millions such as you,&mdash;you, who from your cradle were gall and
      bitterness to your own father&rsquo;s heart, and in whom all evil passions,
      vice, and profligacy, festered, till they found a vent in a hideous
      disease which had made your face an index even to your mind&mdash;you,
      Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no, no!&rsquo; returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated
      charges.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every word!&rsquo; cried the gentleman, &lsquo;every word that has passed between you
      and this detested villain, is known to me. Shadows on the wall have caught
      your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the persecuted
      child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and almost the
      attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you were morally if
      not really a party.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; interposed Monks. &lsquo;I&mdash;I knew nothing of that; I was going
      to inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me. I didn&rsquo;t know the
      cause. I thought it was a common quarrel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow.
      &lsquo;Will you disclose the whole?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, I will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before
      witnesses?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I promise too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed with
      me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose of
      attesting it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you insist upon that, I&rsquo;ll do that also,&rsquo; replied Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must do more than that,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;Make restitution to an
      innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the offspring of
      a guilty and most miserable love. You have not forgotten the provisions of
      the will. Carry them into execution so far as your brother is concerned,
      and then go where you please. In this world you need meet no more.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks on
      this proposal and the possibilities of evading it: torn by his fears on
      the one hand and his hatred on the other: the door was hurriedly unlocked,
      and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in violent agitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The man will be taken,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;He will be taken to-night!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The murderer?&rsquo; asked Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; replied the other. &lsquo;His dog has been seen lurking about some
      old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is, or will
      be, there, under cover of the darkness. Spies are hovering about in every
      direction. I have spoken to the men who are charged with his capture, and
      they tell me he cannot escape. A reward of a hundred pounds is proclaimed
      by Government to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will give fifty more,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;and proclaim it with my own
      lips upon the spot, if I can reach it. Where is Mr. Maylie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Harry? As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with you,
      he hurried off to where he heard this,&rsquo; replied the doctor, &lsquo;and mounting
      his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place in the
      outskirts agreed upon between them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fagin,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;what of him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by this
      time. They&rsquo;re sure of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you made up your mind?&rsquo; asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of
      Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; he replied. &lsquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;will be secret with me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will. Remain here till I return. It is your only hope of safety.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They left the room, and the door was again locked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you done?&rsquo; asked the doctor in a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All that I could hope to do, and even more. Coupling the poor girl&rsquo;s
      intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good
      friend&rsquo;s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and laid
      bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day. Write
      and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the meeting. We
      shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require rest:
      especially the young lady, who <i>may</i> have greater need of firmness
      than either you or I can quite foresee just now. But my blood boils to
      avenge this poor murdered creature. Which way have they taken?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Losberne. &lsquo;I will remain here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement wholly
      uncontrollable.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER L &mdash; THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE
    </h2>
    <p>
      Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe abuts,
      where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on the river
      blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of close-built low-roofed
      houses, there exists the filthiest, the strangest, the most extraordinary
      of the many localities that are hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by
      name, to the great mass of its inhabitants.
    </p>
    <p>
      To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of close,
      narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest of
      waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to
      occasion. The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the
      shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at
      the salesman&rsquo;s door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows.
      Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class, ballast-heavers,
      coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the raff and refuse of
      the river, he makes his way with difficulty along, assailed by offensive
      sights and smells from the narrow alleys which branch off on the right and
      left, and deafened by the clash of ponderous waggons that bear great piles
      of merchandise from the stacks of warehouses that rise from every corner.
      Arriving, at length, in streets remoter and less-frequented than those
      through which he has passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts
      projecting over the pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he
      passes, chimneys half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by
      rusty iron bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every
      imaginable sign of desolation and neglect.
    </p>
    <p>
      In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark,
      stands Jacob&rsquo;s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet deep
      and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill Pond, but
      known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch. It is a creek or inlet
      from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water by opening the
      sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old name. At such times,
      a stranger, looking from one of the wooden bridges thrown across it at
      Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the houses on either side lowering
      from their back doors and windows, buckets, pails, domestic utensils of
      all kinds, in which to haul the water up; and when his eye is turned from
      these operations to the houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be
      excited by the scene before him. Crazy wooden galleries common to the
      backs of half a dozen houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime
      beneath; windows, broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to
      dry the linen that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined,
      that the air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which
      they shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and
      threatening to fall into it&mdash;as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls
      and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every
      loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the
      banks of Folly Ditch.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Jacob&rsquo;s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are
      crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling
      into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.
      Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon it,
      it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed. The
      houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by those who
      have the courage; and there they live, and there they die. They must have
      powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced to a destitute
      condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob&rsquo;s Island.
    </p>
    <p>
      In an upper room of one of these houses&mdash;a detached house of fair
      size, ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window:
      of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already described&mdash;there
      were assembled three men, who, regarding each other every now and then
      with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation, sat for some time in
      profound and gloomy silence. One of these was Toby Crackit, another Mr.
      Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty years, whose nose had been
      almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and whose face bore a frightful
      scar which might probably be traced to the same occasion. This man was a
      returned transport, and his name was Kags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I wish,&rsquo; said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, &lsquo;that you had picked out some
      other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come here, my
      fine feller.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you, blunder-head!&rsquo; said Kags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, I thought you&rsquo;d have been a little more glad to see me than this,&rsquo; 
      replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, look&rsquo;ee, young gentleman,&rsquo; said Toby, &lsquo;when a man keeps himself so
      very exclusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over his
      head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it&rsquo;s rather a startling
      thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman (however
      respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with at
      conweniency) circumstanced as you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping with
      him, that&rsquo;s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts, and is
      too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,&rsquo; added Mr.
      Kags.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon as
      hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care swagger,
      turned to Chitling and said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;When was Fagin took then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Just at dinner-time&mdash;two o&rsquo;clock this afternoon. Charley and I made
      our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty
      water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that they
      stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Bet?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Poor Bet! She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,&rsquo; replied
      Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, &lsquo;and went off mad,
      screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they put
      a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital&mdash;and there she
      is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Wot&rsquo;s come of young Bates?&rsquo; demanded Kags.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he&rsquo;ll be here soon,&rsquo; 
      replied Chitling. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nowhere else to go to now, for the people at
      the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken&mdash;I went up
      there and see it with my own eyes&mdash;is filled with traps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a smash,&rsquo; observed Toby, biting his lips. &lsquo;There&rsquo;s more than one
      will go with this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The sessions are on,&rsquo; said Kags: &lsquo;if they get the inquest over, and
      Bolter turns King&rsquo;s evidence: as of course he will, from what he&rsquo;s said
      already: they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and get the
      trial on on Friday, and he&rsquo;ll swing in six days from this, by G&mdash;!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You should have heard the people groan,&rsquo; said Chitling; &lsquo;the officers
      fought like devils, or they&rsquo;d have torn him away. He was down once, but
      they made a ring round him, and fought their way along. You should have
      seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to them as
      if they were his dearest friends. I can see &lsquo;em now, not able to stand
      upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along amongst &lsquo;em; I
      can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and snarling with their
      teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon his hair and beard, and
      hear the cries with which the women worked themselves into the centre of
      the crowd at the street corner, and swore they&rsquo;d tear his heart out!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his ears,
      and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro, like one
      distracted.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their
      eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs,
      and Sikes&rsquo;s dog bounded into the room. They ran to the window, downstairs,
      and into the street. The dog had jumped in at an open window; he made no
      attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s the meaning of this?&rsquo; said Toby when they had returned. &lsquo;He can&rsquo;t
      be coming here. I&mdash;I&mdash;hope not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he was coming here, he&rsquo;d have come with the dog,&rsquo; said Kags, stooping
      down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor. &lsquo;Here! Give us
      some water for him; he has run himself faint.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s drunk it all up, every drop,&rsquo; said Chitling after watching the dog
      some time in silence. &lsquo;Covered with mud&mdash;lame&mdash;half blind&mdash;he
      must have come a long way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where can he have come from!&rsquo; exclaimed Toby. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s been to the other
      kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here, where
      he&rsquo;s been many a time and often. But where can he have come from first,
      and how comes he here alone without the other!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;&mdash;(none of them called the murderer by his old name)&mdash;&lsquo;He
      can&rsquo;t have made away with himself. What do you think?&rsquo; said Chitling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Toby shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If he had,&rsquo; said Kags, &lsquo;the dog &lsquo;ud want to lead us away to where he did
      it. No. I think he&rsquo;s got out of the country, and left the dog behind. He
      must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn&rsquo;t be so easy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the right;
      the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep, without more
      notice from anybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and placed
      upon the table. The terrible events of the last two days had made a deep
      impression on all three, increased by the danger and uncertainty of their
      own position. They drew their chairs closer together, starting at every
      sound. They spoke little, and that in whispers, and were as silent and
      awe-stricken as if the remains of the murdered woman lay in the next room.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried knocking
      at the door below.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young Bates,&rsquo; said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he felt
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The knocking came again. No, it wasn&rsquo;t he. He never knocked like that.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head. There
      was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough. The dog too
      was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We must let him in,&rsquo; he said, taking up the candle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t there any help for it?&rsquo; asked the other man in a hoarse voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;None. He <i>must</i> come in.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t leave us in the dark,&rsquo; said Kags, taking down a candle from the
      chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the
      knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the
      lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over his
      head under his hat. He drew them slowly off. Blanched face, sunken eyes,
      hollow cheeks, beard of three days&rsquo; growth, wasted flesh, short thick
      breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room, but
      shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance over his
      shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall&mdash;as close as it would go&mdash;and
      ground it against it&mdash;and sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not a word had been exchanged. He looked from one to another in silence.
      If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly averted.
      When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started. They seemed
      never to have heard its tones before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How came that dog here?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alone. Three hours ago.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-night&rsquo;s paper says that Fagin&rsquo;s took. Is it true, or a lie?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;True.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They were silent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn you all!&rsquo; said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you nothing to say to me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You that keep this house,&rsquo; said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit, &lsquo;do
      you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may stop here, if you think it safe,&rsquo; returned the person addressed,
      after some hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him: rather trying to
      turn his head than actually doing it: and said, &lsquo;Is&mdash;it&mdash;the
      body&mdash;is it buried?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They shook their heads.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why isn&rsquo;t it!&rsquo; he retorted with the same glance behind him. &lsquo;Wot do they
      keep such ugly things above the ground for?&mdash;Who&rsquo;s that knocking?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that there
      was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates behind him.
      Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy entered the room
      he encountered his figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Toby,&rsquo; said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards him,
      &lsquo;why didn&rsquo;t you tell me this, downstairs?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the three,
      that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad. Accordingly
      he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me go into some other room,&rsquo; said the boy, retreating still farther.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Charley!&rsquo; said Sikes, stepping forward. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you&mdash;don&rsquo;t you know
      me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t come nearer me,&rsquo; answered the boy, still retreating, and looking,
      with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;You monster!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes&rsquo;s eyes
      sunk gradually to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Witness you three,&rsquo; cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and becoming
      more and more excited as he spoke. &lsquo;Witness you three&mdash;I&rsquo;m not afraid
      of him&mdash;if they come here after him, I&rsquo;ll give him up; I will. I tell
      you out at once. He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he dares, but if
      I am here I&rsquo;ll give him up. I&rsquo;d give him up if he was to be boiled alive.
      Murder! Help! If there&rsquo;s the pluck of a man among you three, you&rsquo;ll help
      me. Murder! Help! Down with him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent gesticulation,
      the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the strong man, and in
      the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of his surprise, brought
      him heavily to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      The three spectators seemed quite stupefied. They offered no interference,
      and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the former, heedless of
      the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his hands tighter and tighter
      in the garments about the murderer&rsquo;s breast, and never ceasing to call for
      help with all his might.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contest, however, was too unequal to last long. Sikes had him down,
      and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with a look
      of alarm, and pointed to the window. There were lights gleaming below,
      voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried footsteps&mdash;endless
      they seemed in number&mdash;crossing the nearest wooden bridge. One man on
      horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there was the noise of hoofs
      rattling on the uneven pavement. The gleam of lights increased; the
      footsteps came more thickly and noisily on. Then, came a loud knocking at
      the door, and then a hoarse murmur from such a multitude of angry voices
      as would have made the boldest quail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Help!&rsquo; shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He&rsquo;s here! Break down the door!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the King&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry arose
      again, but louder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Break down the door!&rsquo; screamed the boy. &lsquo;I tell you they&rsquo;ll never open
      it. Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the door!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower window-shutters
      as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the crowd; giving the
      listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of its immense extent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching Hell-babe,&rsquo; 
      cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the boy, now, as
      easily as if he were an empty sack. &lsquo;That door. Quick!&rsquo; He flung him in,
      bolted it, and turned the key. &lsquo;Is the downstairs door fast?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Double-locked and chained,&rsquo; replied Crackit, who, with the other two men,
      still remained quite helpless and bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The panels&mdash;are they strong?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lined with sheet-iron.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And the windows too?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, and the windows.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Damn you!&rsquo; cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and menacing
      the crowd. &lsquo;Do your worst! I&rsquo;ll cheat you yet!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could exceed
      the cry of the infuriated throng. Some shouted to those who were nearest
      to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to shoot him dead.
      Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on horseback, who,
      throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting through the crowd as if
      he were parting water, cried, beneath the window, in a voice that rose
      above all others, &lsquo;Twenty guineas to the man who brings a ladder!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it. Some called
      for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to and fro as
      if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some spent their
      breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed forward with the
      ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of those below; some
      among the boldest attempted to climb up by the water-spout and crevices in
      the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the darkness beneath, like a field
      of corn moved by an angry wind: and joined from time to time in one loud
      furious roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The tide,&rsquo; cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and
      shut the faces out, &lsquo;the tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a long
      rope. They&rsquo;re all in front. I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and clear off
      that way. Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders and kill
      myself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the
      murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up to
      the house-top.
    </p>
    <p>
      All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up,
      except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that was
      too small even for the passage of his body. But, from this aperture, he
      had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the back; and thus,
      when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by the door in the
      roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in front, who immediately
      began to pour round, pressing upon each other in an unbroken stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose, so
      firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty to open
      it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over the low
      parapet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his motions
      and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it and knew it
      was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to which all
      their previous shouting had been whispers. Again and again it rose. Those
      who were at too great a distance to know its meaning, took up the sound;
      it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the whole city had poured its
      population out to curse him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On pressed the people from the front&mdash;on, on, on, in a strong
      struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch to
      lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion. The
      houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the mob;
      sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and tiers of
      faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging to every
      house-top. Each little bridge (and there were three in sight) bent beneath
      the weight of the crowd upon it. Still the current poured on to find some
      nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only for an instant see
      the wretch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They have him now,&rsquo; cried a man on the nearest bridge. &lsquo;Hurrah!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will give fifty pounds,&rsquo; cried an old gentleman from the same quarter,
      &lsquo;to the man who takes him alive. I will remain here, till he come to ask
      me for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was another roar. At this moment the word was passed among the crowd
      that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first called for the
      ladder had mounted into the room. The stream abruptly turned, as this
      intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at the windows,
      seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their stations, and
      running into the street, joined the concourse that now thronged pell-mell
      to the spot they had left: each man crushing and striving with his
      neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near the door, and look
      upon the criminal as the officers brought him out. The cries and shrieks
      of those who were pressed almost to suffocation, or trampled down and
      trodden under foot in the confusion, were dreadful; the narrow ways were
      completely blocked up; and at this time, between the rush of some to
      regain the space in front of the house, and the unavailing struggles of
      others to extricate themselves from the mass, the immediate attention was
      distracted from the murderer, although the universal eagerness for his
      capture was, if possible, increased.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the crowd,
      and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change with no
      less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet, determined to
      make one last effort for his life by dropping into the ditch, and, at the
      risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in the darkness and
      confusion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within
      the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he
      set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the rope
      tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong running
      noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second. He could let
      himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the ground than his
      own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut it then and drop.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0222.jpg" alt="0222 " width="100%" /><br />

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0222.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to
      slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman
      before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge as
      to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly
      warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down&mdash;at
      that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw his
      arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The eyes again!&rsquo; he cried in an unearthly screech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled over
      the parapet. The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his weight, tight
      as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds. He fell for
      five-and-thirty feet. There was a sudden jerk, a terrific convulsion of
      the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife clenched in his
      stiffening hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The
      murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside the
      dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come and
      take him out, for God&rsquo;s sake.
    </p>
    <p>
      A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on
      the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring,
      jumped for the dead man&rsquo;s shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the
      ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head against a
      stone, dashed out his brains.

      CHAPTER LI &mdash; AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE,
      AND COMPREHENDING A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR
      PIN-MONEY
    </h2>
    <p>
      The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when
      Oliver found himself, at three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon, in a
      travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town. Mrs. Maylie, and
      Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him: and Mr. Brownlow
      followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person whose name had
      not been mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of
      agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting
      his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less
      effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree. He
      and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr. Brownlow
      with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from Monks; and
      although they knew that the object of their present journey was to
      complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole matter was
      enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in endurance of the
      most intense suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne&rsquo;s assistance, cautiously
      stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive
      intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place. &lsquo;It
      was quite true,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;that they must know them before long, but it
      might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be at a
      worse.&rsquo; So, they travelled on in silence: each busied with reflections on
      the object which had brought them together: and no one disposed to give
      utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.
    </p>
    <p>
      But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they
      journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the
      whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a crowd
      of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into that
      which he had traversed on foot: a poor houseless, wandering boy, without a
      friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;See there, there!&rsquo; cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose, and
      pointing out at the carriage window; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s the stile I came over; there
      are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake me and
      force me back! Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to the old
      house where I was a little child! Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old friend, if I
      could only see you now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will see him soon,&rsquo; replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands
      between her own. &lsquo;You shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich you
      have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great as the
      coming back to make him happy too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; said Oliver, &lsquo;and we&rsquo;ll&mdash;we&rsquo;ll take him away from here,
      and have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place
      where he may grow strong and well,&mdash;shall we?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Rose nodded &lsquo;yes,&rsquo; for the boy was smiling through such happy tears that
      she could not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,&rsquo; said Oliver.
      &lsquo;It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but never mind,
      never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile again&mdash;I know
      that too&mdash;to think how changed he is; you did the same with me. He
      said &ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; to me when I ran away,&rsquo; cried the boy with a burst of
      affectionate emotion; &lsquo;and I will say &ldquo;God bless you&rdquo; now, and show him
      how I love him for it!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow
      streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy
      within reasonable bounds. There was Sowerberry&rsquo;s the undertaker&rsquo;s just as
      it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he
      remembered it&mdash;there were all the well-known shops and houses, with
      almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected&mdash;there
      was Gamfield&rsquo;s cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old
      public-house door&mdash;there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his
      youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street&mdash;there
      was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver
      involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so
      foolish, then cried, then laughed again&mdash;there were scores of faces
      at the doors and windows that he knew quite well&mdash;there was nearly
      everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life had
      been but a happy dream.
    </p>
    <p>
      But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality. They drove straight to the door
      of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe, and think
      a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur and size);
      and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing the young
      lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as if he were
      the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness, and not
      offering to eat his head&mdash;no, not once; not even when he contradicted
      a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and maintained he
      knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and that time fast
      asleep. There was dinner prepared, and there were bedrooms ready, and
      everything was arranged as if by magic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was over,
      the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their journey
      down. Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained in a separate
      room. The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with anxious faces, and,
      during the short intervals when they were present, conversed apart. Once,
      Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being absent for nearly an hour,
      returned with eyes swollen with weeping. All these things made Rose and
      Oliver, who were not in any new secrets, nervous and uncomfortable. They
      sat wondering, in silence; or, if they exchanged a few words, spoke in
      whispers, as if they were afraid to hear the sound of their own voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when nine o&rsquo;clock had come, and they began to think they were
      to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered the room,
      followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost shrieked with
      surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother, and it was the same
      man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking in with Fagin at the
      window of his little room. Monks cast a look of hate, which, even then, he
      could not dissemble, at the astonished boy, and sat down near the door.
      Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand, walked to a table near which
      Rose and Oliver were seated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is a painful task,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;but these declarations, which have
      been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance repeated
      here. I would have spared you the degradation, but we must hear them from
      your own lips before we part, and you know why.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said the person addressed, turning away his face. &lsquo;Quick. I have
      almost done enough, I think. Don&rsquo;t keep me here.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This child,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his
      hand upon his head, &lsquo;is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your
      father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who
      died in giving him birth.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy: the beating of whose
      heart he might have heard. &lsquo;That is the bastard child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The term you use,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, &lsquo;is a reproach to those
      long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects
      disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass. He was
      born in this town.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In the workhouse of this town,&rsquo; was the sullen reply. &lsquo;You have the story
      there.&rsquo; He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must have it here, too,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the
      listeners.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen then! You!&rsquo; returned Monks. &lsquo;His father being taken ill at Rome,
      was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long separated,
      who went from Paris and took me with her&mdash;to look after his property,
      for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor he for her.
      He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he slumbered on till
      next day, when he died. Among the papers in his desk, were two, dated on
      the night his illness first came on, directed to yourself&rsquo;; he addressed
      himself to Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;and enclosed in a few short lines to you, with
      an intimation on the cover of the package that it was not to be forwarded
      till after he was dead. One of these papers was a letter to this girl
      Agnes; the other a will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What of the letter?&rsquo; asked Mr. Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The letter?&mdash;A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a
      penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her. He had palmed a tale
      on the girl that some secret mystery&mdash;to be explained one day&mdash;prevented
      his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on, trusting patiently to
      him, until she trusted too far, and lost what none could ever give her
      back. She was, at that time, within a few months of her confinement. He
      told her all he had meant to do, to hide her shame, if he had lived, and
      prayed her, if he died, not to curse his memory, or think the consequences
      of their sin would be visited on her or their young child; for all the
      guilt was his. He reminded her of the day he had given her the little
      locket and the ring with her christian name engraved upon it, and a blank
      left for that which he hoped one day to have bestowed upon her&mdash;prayed
      her yet to keep it, and wear it next her heart, as she had done before&mdash;and
      then ran on, wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had
      gone distracted. I believe he had.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The will,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver&rsquo;s tears fell fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monks was silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The will,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, &lsquo;was in the same spirit
      as the letter. He talked of miseries which his wife had brought upon him;
      of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature bad passions of
      you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and left you, and your
      mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds. The bulk of his property
      he divided into two equal portions&mdash;one for Agnes Fleming, and the
      other for their child, if it should be born alive, and ever come of age.
      If it were a girl, it was to inherit the money unconditionally; but if a
      boy, only on the stipulation that in his minority he should never have
      stained his name with any public act of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or
      wrong. He did this, he said, to mark his confidence in the other, and his
      conviction&mdash;only strengthened by approaching death&mdash;that the
      child would share her gentle heart, and noble nature. If he were
      disappointed in this expectation, then the money was to come to you: for
      then, and not till then, when both children were equal, would he recognise
      your prior claim upon his purse, who had none upon his heart, but had,
      from an infant, repulsed him with coldness and aversion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My mother,&rsquo; said Monks, in a louder tone, &lsquo;did what a woman should have
      done. She burnt this will. The letter never reached its destination; but
      that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever tried to lie away the
      blot. The girl&rsquo;s father had the truth from her with every aggravation that
      her violent hate&mdash;I love her for it now&mdash;could add. Goaded by
      shame and dishonour he fled with his children into a remote corner of
      Wales, changing his very name that his friends might never know of his
      retreat; and here, no great while afterwards, he was found dead in his
      bed. The girl had left her home, in secret, some weeks before; he had
      searched for her, on foot, in every town and village near; it was on the
      night when he returned home, assured that she had destroyed herself, to
      hide her shame and his, that his old heart broke.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread of
      the narrative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Years after this,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;this man&rsquo;s&mdash;Edward Leeford&rsquo;s&mdash;mother
      came to me. He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and
      money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London: where for two
      years he had associated with the lowest outcasts. She was sinking under a
      painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before she died.
      Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They were unavailing
      for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went back with her to
      France.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There she died,&rsquo; said Monks, &lsquo;after a lingering illness; and, on her
      death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her
      unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved&mdash;though she
      need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before. She would
      not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child too, but
      was filled with the impression that a male child had been born, and was
      alive. I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to hunt it down; never
      to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and most unrelenting
      animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply felt, and to spit upon
      the empty vaunt of that insulting will by draggin it, if I could, to the
      very gallows-foot. She was right. He came in my way at last. I began well;
      and, but for babbling drabs, I would have finished as I began!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on
      himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the
      terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been his
      old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver
      ensnared: of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his being
      rescued: and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit to the
      country house for the purpose of identifying him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The locket and ring?&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them from
      the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,&rsquo; answered Monks without raising
      his eyes. &lsquo;You know what became of them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great
      alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her
      unwilling consort after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do my hi&rsquo;s deceive me!&rsquo; cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,
      &lsquo;or is that little Oliver? Oh O-li-ver, if you know&rsquo;d how I&rsquo;ve been
      a-grieving for you&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongue, fool,&rsquo; murmured Mrs. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?&rsquo; remonstrated the workhouse master.
      &lsquo;Can&rsquo;t I be supposed to feel&mdash;<i>I</i> as brought him up porochially&mdash;when
      I see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest
      description! I always loved that boy as if he&rsquo;d been my&mdash;my&mdash;my
      own grandfather,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.
      &lsquo;Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the white
      waistcoat? Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with plated
      handles, Oliver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; &lsquo;suppress your feelings.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do my endeavours, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Bumble. &lsquo;How do you do, sir? I
      hope you are very well.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to
      within a short distance of the respectable couple. He inquired, as he
      pointed to Monks,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you know that person?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perhaps <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t?&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never saw him in all my life,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor sold him anything, perhaps?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Bumble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?&rsquo; said Mr.
      Brownlow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Certainly not,&rsquo; replied the matron. &lsquo;Why are we brought here to answer to
      such nonsense as this?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman limped
      away with extraordinary readiness. But not again did he return with a
      stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women, who shook
      and tottered as they walked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shut the door the night old Sally died,&rsquo; said the foremost one,
      raising her shrivelled hand, &lsquo;but you couldn&rsquo;t shut out the sound, nor
      stop the chinks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless
      jaws. &lsquo;No, no, no.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We heard her try to tell you what she&rsquo;d done, and saw you take a paper
      from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker&rsquo;s shop,&rsquo; 
      said the first.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; added the second, &lsquo;and it was a &ldquo;locket and gold ring.&rdquo; We found
      out that, and saw it given you. We were by. Oh! we were by.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And we know more than that,&rsquo; resumed the first, &lsquo;for she told us often,
      long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she should
      never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was taken ill,
      to die near the grave of the father of the child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?&rsquo; asked Mr. Grimwig with a
      motion towards the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; replied the woman; &lsquo;if he&mdash;she pointed to Monks&mdash;&lsquo;has been
      coward enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these
      hags till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say. I <i>did</i>
      sell them, and they&rsquo;re where you&rsquo;ll never get them. What then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow, &lsquo;except that it remains for us to take
      care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again. You
      may leave the room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as Mr.
      Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: &lsquo;I hope that this unfortunate
      little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial office?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Indeed it will,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;You may make up your mind to
      that, and think yourself well off besides.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was all Mrs. Bumble. She <i>would</i> do it,&rsquo; urged Mr. Bumble; first
      looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That is no excuse,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;You were present on the
      occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more
      guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that your
      wife acts under your direction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the law supposes that,&rsquo; said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat
      emphatically in both hands, &lsquo;the law is a ass&mdash;a idiot. If that&rsquo;s the
      eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is,
      that his eye may be opened by experience&mdash;by experience.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble fixed
      his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets, followed his
      helpmate downstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Young lady,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, &lsquo;give me your hand. Do
      not tremble. You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we have to
      say.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If they have&mdash;I do not know how they can, but if they have&mdash;any
      reference to me,&rsquo; said Rose, &lsquo;pray let me hear them at some other time. I
      have not strength or spirits now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nay,&rsquo; returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; &lsquo;you have
      more fortitude than this, I am sure. Do you know this young lady, sir?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; replied Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I never saw you before,&rsquo; said Rose faintly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have seen you often,&rsquo; returned Monks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The father of the unhappy Agnes had <i>two</i> daughters,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Brownlow. &lsquo;What was the fate of the other&mdash;the child?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The child,&rsquo; replied Monks, &lsquo;when her father died in a strange place, in a
      strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that yielded the
      faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be traced&mdash;the
      child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it as their own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go on,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. &lsquo;Go on!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You couldn&rsquo;t find the spot to which these people had repaired,&rsquo; said
      Monks, &lsquo;but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way. My
      mother found it, after a year of cunning search&mdash;ay, and found the
      child.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She took it, did she?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No. The people were poor and began to sicken&mdash;at least the man did&mdash;of
      their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a small present
      of money which would not last long, and promised more, which she never
      meant to send. She didn&rsquo;t quite rely, however, on their discontent and
      poverty for the child&rsquo;s unhappiness, but told the history of the sister&rsquo;s
      shame, with such alterations as suited her; bade them take good heed of
      the child, for she came of bad blood; and told them she was illegitimate,
      and sure to go wrong at one time or other. The circumstances countenanced
      all this; the people believed it; and there the child dragged on an
      existence, miserable enough even to satisfy us, until a widow lady,
      residing, then, at Chester, saw the girl by chance, pitied her, and took
      her home. There was some cursed spell, I think, against us; for in spite
      of all our efforts she remained there and was happy. I lost sight of her,
      two or three years ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do you see her now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes. Leaning on your arm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not the less my niece,&rsquo; cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting girl
      in her arms; &lsquo;not the less my dearest child. I would not lose her now, for
      all the treasures of the world. My sweet companion, my own dear girl!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The only friend I ever had,&rsquo; cried Rose, clinging to her. &lsquo;The kindest,
      best of friends. My heart will burst. I cannot bear all this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest
      creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,&rsquo; said Mrs.
      Maylie, embracing her tenderly. &lsquo;Come, come, my love, remember who this is
      who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child! See here&mdash;look, look,
      my dear!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not aunt,&rsquo; cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll never
      call her aunt&mdash;sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my
      heart to love so dearly from the first! Rose, dear, darling Rose!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in the
      long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred. A father, sister, and
      mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment. Joy and grief were
      mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears: for even grief itself
      arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and tender recollections,
      that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all character of pain.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were a long, long time alone. A soft tap at the door, at length
      announced that some one was without. Oliver opened it, glided away, and
      gave place to Harry Maylie.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know it all,&rsquo; he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl. &lsquo;Dear
      Rose, I know it all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not here by accident,&rsquo; he added after a lengthened silence; &lsquo;nor
      have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday&mdash;only
      yesterday. Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay,&rsquo; said Rose. &lsquo;You <i>do</i> know all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All. You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the subject
      of our last discourse.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I did.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not to press you to alter your determination,&rsquo; pursued the young man,
      &lsquo;but to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of station
      or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still adhered to your
      former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or act, to seek to
      change it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,&rsquo; said
      Rose firmly. &lsquo;If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her, whose
      goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when should I
      ever feel it, as I should to-night? It is a struggle,&rsquo; said Rose, &lsquo;but one
      I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall bear.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The disclosure of to-night,&rsquo;&mdash;Harry began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The disclosure of to-night,&rsquo; replied Rose softly, &lsquo;leaves me in the same
      position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You harden your heart against me, Rose,&rsquo; urged her lover.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh Harry, Harry,&rsquo; said the young lady, bursting into tears; &lsquo;I wish I
      could, and spare myself this pain.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then why inflict it on yourself?&rsquo; said Harry, taking her hand. &lsquo;Think,
      dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what have I heard! What have I heard!&rsquo; cried Rose. &lsquo;That a sense of
      his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned all&mdash;there,
      we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not yet, not yet,&rsquo; said the young man, detaining her as she rose. &lsquo;My
      hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling: every thought in life except my love
      for you: have undergone a change. I offer you, now, no distinction among a
      bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice and detraction, where
      the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught but real disgrace and
      shame; but a home&mdash;a heart and home&mdash;yes, dearest Rose, and
      those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What do you mean!&rsquo; she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I mean but this&mdash;that when I left you last, I left you with a firm
      determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me;
      resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine;
      that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn from
      it. This I have done. Those who have shrunk from me because of this, have
      shrunk from you, and proved you so far right. Such power and patronage:
      such relatives of influence and rank: as smiled upon me then, look coldly
      now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees in England&rsquo;s richest
      county; and by one village church&mdash;mine, Rose, my own!&mdash;there
      stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of, than all the
      hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold. This is my rank and
      station now, and here I lay it down!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig, waking
      up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time.
      Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together), could
      offer a word in extenuation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,&rsquo; said Mr. Grimwig,
      &lsquo;for I began to think I should get nothing else. I&rsquo;ll take the liberty, if
      you&rsquo;ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the
      blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by the
      doctor and Mr. Brownlow: some people affirm that Harry Maylie had been
      observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the best
      authorities consider this downright scandal: he being young and a
      clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oliver, my child,&rsquo; said Mrs. Maylie, &lsquo;where have you been, and why do you
      look so sad? There are tears stealing down your face at this moment. What
      is the matter?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is a world of disappointment: often to the hopes we most cherish, and
      hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LII &mdash; FAGIN&rsquo;S LAST NIGHT ALIVE
    </h2>
    <p>
      The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive and
      eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before the dock,
      away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the galleries, all
      looks were fixed upon one man&mdash;Fagin. Before him and behind: above,
      below, on the right and on the left: he seemed to stand surrounded by a
      firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand resting
      on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and his head
      thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater distinctness every word
      that fell from the presiding judge, who was delivering his charge to the
      jury. At times, he turned his eyes sharply upon them to observe the effect
      of the slightest featherweight in his favour; and when the points against
      him were stated with terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in
      mute appeal that he would, even then, urge something in his behalf. Beyond
      these manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot. He had
      scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to
      speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close attention,
      with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still.
    </p>
    <p>
      A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself. Looking round, he
      saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict. As
      his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising above
      each other to see his face: some hastily applying their glasses to their
      eyes: and others whispering their neighbours with looks expressive of
      abhorrence. A few there were, who seemed unmindful of him, and looked only
      to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could delay. But in no one face&mdash;not
      even among the women, of whom there were many there&mdash;could he read
      the faintest sympathy with himself, or any feeling but one of
      all-absorbing interest that he should be condemned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness came
      again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards the
      judge. Hush!
    </p>
    <p>
      They only sought permission to retire.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed out,
      as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was
      fruitless. The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed
      mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair. The man
      pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up into the gallery again. Some of the people were eating, and
      some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place was very
      hot. There was one young man sketching his face in a little note-book. He
      wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the artist broke his
      pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any idle spectator might
      have done.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind began
      to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost, and how he
      put it on. There was an old fat gentleman on the bench, too, who had gone
      out, some half an hour before, and now come back. He wondered within
      himself whether this man had been to get his dinner, what he had had, and
      where he had had it; and pursued this train of careless thought until some
      new object caught his eye and roused another.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one
      oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it was
      ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could not fix
      his thoughts upon it. Thus, even while he trembled, and turned burning hot
      at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron spikes before
      him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken off, and whether
      they would mend it, or leave it as it was. Then, he thought of all the
      horrors of the gallows and the scaffold&mdash;and stopped to watch a man
      sprinkling the floor to cool it&mdash;and then went on to think again.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all
      towards the door. The jury returned, and passed him close. He could glean
      nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone. Perfect
      stillness ensued&mdash;not a rustle&mdash;not a breath&mdash;Guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another, and
      then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled out,
      like angry thunder. It was a peal of joy from the populace outside,
      greeting the news that he would die on Monday.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why
      sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his
      listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the demand
      was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it, and then
      he only muttered that he was an old man&mdash;an old man&mdash;and so,
      dropping into a whisper, was silent again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the
      same air and gesture. A woman in the gallery, uttered some exclamation,
      called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up as if angry at
      the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively. The address was
      solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear. But he stood, like a
      marble figure, without the motion of a nerve. His haggard face was still
      thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and his eyes staring out
      before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his arm, and beckoned him
      away. He gazed stupidly about him for an instant, and obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners
      were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their
      friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard. There
      was nobody there to speak to <i>him</i>; but, as he passed, the prisoners
      fell back to render him more visible to the people who were clinging to
      the bars: and they assailed him with opprobrious names, and screeched and
      hissed. He shook his fist, and would have spat upon them; but his
      conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage lighted by a few dim
      lamps, into the interior of the prison.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of
      anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of the
      condemned cells, and left him there&mdash;alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat and
      bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to
      collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few disjointed
      fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed to him, at the
      time, that he could not hear a word. These gradually fell into their
      proper places, and by degrees suggested more: so that in a little time he
      had the whole, almost as it was delivered. To be hanged by the neck, till
      he was dead&mdash;that was the end. To be hanged by the neck till he was
      dead.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0234.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known who
      had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means. They rose up,
      in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them. He had seen
      some of them die,&mdash;and had joked too, because they died with prayers
      upon their lips. With what a rattling noise the drop went down; and how
      suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to dangling heaps of
      clothes!
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of them might have inhabited that very cell&mdash;sat upon that very
      spot. It was very dark; why didn&rsquo;t they bring a light? The cell had been
      built for many years. Scores of men must have passed their last hours
      there. It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead bodies&mdash;the
      cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew, even beneath
      that hideous veil.&mdash;Light, light!
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door and
      walls, two men appeared: one bearing a candle, which he thrust into an
      iron candlestick fixed against the wall: the other dragging in a mattress
      on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left alone no more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then came the night&mdash;dark, dismal, silent night. Other watchers are
      glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming
      day. To him they brought despair. The boom of every iron bell came laden
      with the one, deep, hollow sound&mdash;Death. What availed the noise and
      bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him? It was
      another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day passed off. Day? There was no day; it was gone as soon as come&mdash;and
      night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in its dreadful
      silence, and short in its fleeting hours. At one time he raved and
      blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair. Venerable men of his
      own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he had driven them away
      with curses. They renewed their charitable efforts, and he beat them off.
    </p>
    <p>
      Saturday night. He had only one night more to live. And as he thought of
      this, the day broke&mdash;Sunday.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering sense
      of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon his
      blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive hope of
      mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than the dim
      probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of the two
      men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and they, for
      their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention. He had sat there,
      awake, but dreaming. Now, he started up, every minute, and with gasping
      mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a paroxysm of fear and
      wrath that even they&mdash;used to such sights&mdash;recoiled from him
      with horror. He grew so terrible, at last, in all the tortures of his evil
      conscience, that one man could not bear to sit there, eyeing him alone;
      and so the two kept watch together.
    </p>
    <p>
      He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had been
      wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his capture, and
      his head was bandaged with a linen cloth. His red hair hung down upon his
      bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into knots; his eyes shone
      with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh crackled with the fever that
      burnt him up. Eight&mdash;nine&mdash;then. If it was not a trick to
      frighten him, and those were the real hours treading on each other&rsquo;s
      heels, where would he be, when they came round again! Eleven! Another
      struck, before the voice of the previous hour had ceased to vibrate. At
      eight, he would be the only mourner in his own funeral train; at eleven&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and such
      unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and too long,
      from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as that. The
      few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man was doing who
      was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that night, if they
      could have seen him.
    </p>
    <p>
      From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two and
      three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with anxious
      faces, whether any reprieve had been received. These being answered in the
      negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to clusters in the street,
      who pointed out to one another the door from which he must come out, and
      showed where the scaffold would be built, and, walking with unwilling
      steps away, turned back to conjure up the scene. By degrees they fell off,
      one by one; and, for an hour, in the dead of night, the street was left to
      solitude and darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,
      painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the
      pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared at
      the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner, signed by
      one of the sheriffs. They were immediately admitted into the lodge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?&rsquo; said the man whose duty it was
      to conduct them. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s not a sight for children, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is not indeed, my friend,&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Brownlow; &lsquo;but my business
      with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has seen
      him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as well&mdash;even
      at the cost of some pain and fear&mdash;that he should see him now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver. The
      man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity, opened
      another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and led them on,
      through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of
      workmen were making some preparations in profound silence&mdash;&lsquo;this is
      the place he passes through. If you step this way, you can see the door he
      goes out at.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the
      prison food, and pointed to a door. There was an open grating above it,
      through which came the sound of men&rsquo;s voices, mingled with the noise of
      hammering, and the throwing down of boards. There were putting up the
      scaffold.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by other
      turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard, ascended a
      flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row of strong doors
      on the left hand. Motioning them to remain where they were, the turnkey
      knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The two attendants, after
      a little whispering, came out into the passage, stretching themselves as
      if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned the visitors to follow the
      jailer into the cell. They did so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side to
      side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the face of
      a man. His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for he continued
      to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence otherwise than as
      a part of his vision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good boy, Charley&mdash;well done&mdash;&rsquo; he mumbled. &lsquo;Oliver, too, ha!
      ha! ha! Oliver too&mdash;quite the gentleman now&mdash;quite the&mdash;take
      that boy away to bed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not to
      be alarmed, looked on without speaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take him away to bed!&rsquo; cried Fagin. &lsquo;Do you hear me, some of you? He has
      been the&mdash;the&mdash;somehow the cause of all this. It&rsquo;s worth the
      money to bring him up to it&mdash;Bolter&rsquo;s throat, Bill; never mind the
      girl&mdash;Bolter&rsquo;s throat as deep as you can cut. Saw his head off!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fagin,&rsquo; said the jailer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s me!&rsquo; cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of
      listening he had assumed upon his trial. &lsquo;An old man, my Lord; a very old,
      old man!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here,&rsquo; said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him
      down. &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I
      suppose. Fagin, Fagin! Are you a man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shan&rsquo;t be one long,&rsquo; he replied, looking up with a face retaining no
      human expression but rage and terror. &lsquo;Strike them all dead! What right
      have they to butcher me?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to the
      furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Steady,&rsquo; said the turnkey, still holding him down. &lsquo;Now, sir, tell him
      what you want. Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the time gets
      on.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have some papers,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow advancing, &lsquo;which were placed in
      your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s all a lie together,&rsquo; replied Fagin. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t one&mdash;not one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For the love of God,&rsquo; said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, &lsquo;do not say that now,
      upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are. You know that
      Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no hope of any
      further gain. Where are those papers?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oliver,&rsquo; cried Fagin, beckoning to him. &lsquo;Here, here! Let me whisper to
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not afraid,&rsquo; said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr.
      Brownlow&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The papers,&rsquo; said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, &lsquo;are in a canvas
      bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room. I want
      to talk to you, my dear. I want to talk to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, yes,&rsquo; returned Oliver. &lsquo;Let me say a prayer. Do! Let me say one
      prayer. Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk till
      morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Outside, outside,&rsquo; replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards the
      door, and looking vacantly over his head. &lsquo;Say I&rsquo;ve gone to sleep&mdash;they&rsquo;ll
      believe you. You can get me out, if you take me so. Now then, now then!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! God forgive this wretched man!&rsquo; cried the boy with a burst of tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That&rsquo;s right, that&rsquo;s right,&rsquo; said Fagin. &lsquo;That&rsquo;ll help us on. This door
      first. If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don&rsquo;t you mind, but
      hurry on. Now, now, now!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?&rsquo; inquired the turnkey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No other question,&rsquo; replied Mr. Brownlow. &lsquo;If I hoped we could recall him
      to a sense of his position&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing will do that, sir,&rsquo; replied the man, shaking his head. &lsquo;You had
      better leave him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Press on, press on,&rsquo; cried Fagin. &lsquo;Softly, but not so slow. Faster,
      faster!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp, held
      him back. He struggled with the power of desperation, for an instant; and
      then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those massive walls, and
      rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was some time before they left the prison. Oliver nearly swooned after
      this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more, he had not
      the strength to walk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Day was dawning when they again emerged. A great multitude had already
      assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing cards
      to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking.
      Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects in
      the centre of all&mdash;the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and all
      the hideous apparatus of death.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER LIII &mdash; AND LAST
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed. The
      little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few and
      simple words.
    </h3>
    <p>
      Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were married
      in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of the young
      clergyman&rsquo;s labours; on the same day they entered into possession of their
      new and happy home.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to enjoy,
      during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity that age
      and worth can know&mdash;the contemplation of the happiness of those on
      whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a well-spent life, have
      been unceasingly bestowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of
      property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered
      either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided
      between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than
      three thousand pounds. By the provisions of his father&rsquo;s will, Oliver
      would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to
      deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices
      and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to
      which his young charge joyfully acceded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a
      distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he
      once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long
      confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk under
      an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison. As far from home, died
      the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin&rsquo;s gang.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son. Removing with him and the old
      housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear
      friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver&rsquo;s warm and
      earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose condition
      approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever be known in
      this changing world.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

      <a href="images/0240.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned to
      Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would have
      been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a feeling; and
      would have turned quite peevish if he had known how. For two or three
      months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared the air began to
      disagree with him; then, finding that the place really no longer was, to
      him, what it had been, he settled his business on his assistant, took a
      bachelor&rsquo;s cottage outside the village of which his young friend was
      pastor, and instantaneously recovered. Here he took to gardening,
      planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other pursuits of a similar
      kind: all undertaken with his characteristic impetuosity. In each and all
      he has since become famous throughout the neighborhood, as a most profound
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for Mr.
      Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated. He is
      accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course of the
      year. On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and carpenters,
      with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and unprecedented
      manner, but always maintaining with his favourite asseveration, that his
      mode is the right one. On Sundays, he never fails to criticise the sermon
      to the young clergyman&rsquo;s face: always informing Mr. Losberne, in strict
      confidence afterwards, that he considers it an excellent performance, but
      deems it as well not to say so. It is a standing and very favourite joke,
      for Mr. Brownlow to rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and
      to remind him of the night on which they sat with the watch between them,
      waiting his return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the
      main, and, in proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after
      all; which always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good
      humour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Noah Claypole: receiving a free pardon from the Crown in consequence
      of being admitted approver against Fagin: and considering his profession
      not altogether as safe a one as he could wish: was, for some little time,
      at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened with too much work.
      After some consideration, he went into business as an Informer, in which
      calling he realises a genteel subsistence. His plan is, to walk out once a
      week during church time attended by Charlotte in respectable attire. The
      lady faints away at the doors of charitable publicans, and the gentleman
      being accommodated with three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays
      an information next day, and pockets half the penalty. Sometimes Mr.
      Claypole faints himself, but the result is the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually reduced
      to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in that very
      same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others. Mr. Bumble
      has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation, he has not
      even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts,
      although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey. They sleep
      at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among its
      inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to this day
      the villagers have never been able to discover to which establishment they
      properly belong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes&rsquo;s crime, fell into a train of
      reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best. Arriving
      at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back upon the
      scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of action. He
      struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but, having a contented
      disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the end; and, from being a
      farmer&rsquo;s drudge, and a carrier&rsquo;s lad, he is now the merriest young grazier
      in all Northamptonshire.
    </p>
    <p>
      And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches the
      conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space, the
      thread of these adventures.
    </p>
    <p>
      I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long
      moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it. I would
      show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood, shedding
      on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell on all who
      trod it with her, and shone into their hearts. I would paint her the life
      and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively summer group; I would
      follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and hear the low tones of
      her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I would watch her in all her
      goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling untiring discharge of
      domestic duties at home; I would paint her and her dead sister&rsquo;s child
      happy in their love for one another, and passing whole hours together in
      picturing the friends whom they had so sadly lost; I would summon before
      me, once again, those joyous little faces that clustered round her knee,
      and listen to their merry prattle; I would recall the tones of that clear
      laugh, and conjure up the sympathising tear that glistened in the soft
      blue eye. These, and a thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and
      speech&mdash;I would fain recall them every one.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his adopted
      child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him, more and
      more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving seeds of all
      he wished him to become&mdash;how he traced in him new traits of his early
      friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances, melancholy and
      yet sweet and soothing&mdash;how the two orphans, tried by adversity,
      remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love, and fervent
      thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them&mdash;these are all
      matters which need not to be told. I have said that they were truly happy;
      and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and gratitude to that
      Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute is Benevolence to all
      things that breathe, happiness can never be attained.

      Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble
      tablet, which bears as yet but one word: &lsquo;AGNES.&rsquo; There is no coffin in
      that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is placed
      above it! But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to earth, to
      visit spots hallowed by the love&mdash;the love beyond the grave&mdash;of
      those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of Agnes sometimes
      hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the less because that
      nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.

    <p>
      &lsquo;The delineation of such characters as these I consider as very moral
      instruction to mankind, and a lesson more demonstrative of the perfect
      vanity of unused wealth, than has lately been presented to the public.&rsquo;&mdash;Topham&rsquo;s
      <i>Life of Elwes</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other and lighter portions of the Tale refer to the adventures of a young
      man on his first introduction to town life about the middle of the
      eighteenth century, when Ranelagh was in its zenith, and Vauxhall and
      Marylebone Gardens in vogue; when the Thames boasted its Folly; and when
      coffee-houses filled the place of clubs. The descriptions I believe to be
      tolerably accurate; and they are at all events carefully done, with the
      view of giving a correct idea of the manners, habits, and pursuits of our
      great-grandfathers and great-grandmothers. Temptations to pleasurable
      excess were no doubt sufficiently abundant then.

      old-fashioned house at the corner of the Little Sanctuary in Westminster,
      and facing the abbey, dwelt, in the year 1744, a person named Scarve. From
      his extraordinary penurious habits, he received the appellation of <i>Starve</i>,
      and was generally denominated by his neighbours &lsquo;Miser Starve.&rsquo; Few, if
      any, of those who thus designated him, knew much about him, none of them
      being allowed to cross his threshold; but there was an air, even
      externally, about his dwelling, strongly indicative of his parsimonious
      character. Most of the windows in the upper stories, which, as is usual
      with habitations of that date, far overhung the lower, were boarded up;
      and those not thus closed were so covered with dust and dirt that it was
      impossible to discern any object through them. Many parts of the building
      were in a ruinous condition, and, where the dilapidations were not
      dangerous, were left in that state; but wherever some repairs were
      absolutely necessary to keep the structure together, they were made in the
      readiest and cheapest manner. The porch alone preserved its original
      character. It projected far beyond the door-way, and was ornamented with
      the arms of a former occupant of the habitation, carved in bold relief in
      oak, and supported by two mermaids sculptured in the same wood. All the
      lower windows were strongly grated, and darkened like the upper with
      long-accumulated dust. The door was kept constantly bolted and barred,
      even in the daytime; and the whole building had a dingy, dismal, and
      dungeon-like aspect.

      <span class="head">RANDULPH CREW DELIVERING THE PACKET TO MR. SCARVE&mdash;THE
      MISER AND HIS DAUGHTER&mdash;-RANDULPH DELIVERS THE PACKET TO THE FORMER</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>ollowing his
      conductor along the passage, the boards of which, being totally destitute
      of carpet or cloth, sounded hollowly beneath their feet, Randulph Crew
      glanced at the bare walls, the dusty and cobweb-festooned ceiling, and the
      staircase, as devoid of covering as the passage, and could not but admit
      that the account given him by the barber of Mr. Scarve&rsquo;s miserly habits
      was not exaggerated. Little time, however, was allowed him for reflection.
      Jacob marched quickly on, and pushing open a door on the right, ushered
      him into his master&rsquo;s presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scarve was an old man, and looked much older than he really was&mdash;being
      only sixty-five, whereas he appeared like eighty. His frame was pinched as
      if by self-denial, and preternaturally withered and shrivelled; and there
      was a thin, haggard, and almost hungry look about his face, extremely
      painful to contemplate. His features were strongly marked, and sharp, and
      his eye, grey, keen, and piercing. He was dressed in a thread-bare cloth
      robe, trimmed with sable, and wore a velvet nightcap, lined with cotton,
      on his head. The rest of his habiliments were darned and patched in an
      unseemly manner. Beside him was a small table, on which was laid a ragged
      and dirty cloth, covered with the remains of his scanty meal, which
      Randulph&rsquo;s arrival had interrupted. Part of a stale loaf, a slice of
      cheese, and a little salt constituted the repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything in the room bespoke the avaricious character of its owner. The
      panelled walls were without hangings or decoration of any kind. The room
      itself, it was evident, had known better days and richer garniture. It was
      plain, but handsome in its character, and boasted a large and well-carved
      chimney-piece, and a window filled with stained glass displaying the
      armorial bearings of the former possessor of the house, though now patched
      in many places with paper, and stopped up in others with rags. This window
      was strongly grated, and the bars were secured in their turn by a large
      padlock, placed inside the room. Over the chimney-piece were placed a
      couple of large blue and white china bottles, with dried everlasting
      flowers stuck in the necks. There were only two chairs in the room and a
      stool. The best chair was appropriated by the miser himself. It was an
      old-fashioned affair, with great wooden arms, and a hard leathern back,
      polished like a well-blacked shoe by frequent use. A few coals, carefully
      piled into a little pyramid, burnt within the bars, as if to show the
      emptiness of the grate, and diffused a slight gleam, like a mocking laugh,
      but no sort of heat. Beside it sat Mrs. Clinton, an elderly maiden lady,
      almost as wintry-looking and pinched as her brother-in-law. This
      antiquated lady had a long thin neck and a skin as yellow as parchment;
      but the expression of her countenance, though rather sharp and frosty, was
      kindly. She wore a close-fitting gown of dark camlet, with short tight
      sleeves, that by no means concealed the angularities of her figure. Her
      hair, which was still dark as in her youth, was gathered up closely
      behind, and surmounted by the small muslin cap then in vogue.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object, however, that chiefly riveted Randulph&rsquo;s attention on his
      entrance was neither the miser himself nor his sister-in-law&mdash;it was
      his daughter. Her beauty was so extraordinary that it acted like a
      surprise upon him, occasioning a thrill of delight, mingled with a feeling
      of embarrassment. Rising as he entered the room, she gracefully, and with
      much natural dignity, returned his salutation, which, through
      inadvertence, he addressed almost exclusively to her. Hilda Scarve&rsquo;s age
      might be guessed at nineteen. She was tall, exquisitely proportioned, with
      a pale clear complexion, set off by her rich raven tresses, which, totally
      unrestrained, showered down in a thick cloud over her shoulders. Her eyes
      were large and dark, luminous, but steady, and indicated firmness of
      character. Her look was grave and sedate, and there was great
      determination in her beautifully formed but closely compressed lips. Her
      aspect and deportment exhibited the most perfect self-command, and
      whatever effect might be produced upon her by the sudden entrance of the
      handsome visitor, not a glance was suffered to reveal it, while he, on the
      contrary, could not repress the admiration excited by her beauty. He was,
      however, speedily recalled to himself by the miser, who, rapping the table
      impatiently, exclaimed, in a querulous tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your business, sir?&mdash;your business?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0256.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have come to deliver this to you, sir,&rsquo; replied Randulph, producing a
      small packet, and handing it to the miser. &lsquo;I should tell you, sir,&rsquo; he
      added, in a voice of emotion, &lsquo;that it was my father&rsquo;s wish that this
      packet should be given to you a year after his death&mdash;but not
      before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And your father&rsquo;s name,&rsquo; cried the miser, bending eagerly forward, and
      shading his eyes so as to enable him to see the young man more distinctly,
      &lsquo;was&mdash;was&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The same as my own, Randulph Crew,&rsquo; was the reply. &lsquo;Gracious heaven!&rsquo; 
      exclaimed the miser, falling back in his chair, &lsquo;and is he dead?&mdash;my
      friend&mdash;my old friend!&rsquo; and he pressed his hand to his face, as if to
      hide his emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda bent anxiously over him, and tried to soothe him, but he pushed her
      gently away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Having discharged my mission, I will now take my leave,&rsquo; said Randulph,
      after a slight pause, during which he looked on in silent astonishment. &lsquo;I
      will call at some other time, Miss Scarve, to speak to your father
      respecting the packet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, stay!&rsquo; cried Hilda hastily. &lsquo;Some old and secret spring of affection
      has been touched. I entreat you to wait till he recovers. He will be
      better presently.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is better now,&rsquo; replied the miser, uncovering his face; &lsquo;the fit is
      past; but it was sharp while it lasted. Randulph Crew,&rsquo; he added faintly,
      and stretching out his thin hand to him, &lsquo;I am glad to see you. Years ago,
      I knew your father well. But unhappy circumstances separated us, and since
      then I have seen nothing of him. I fancied him alive, and well, and happy,
      and your sudden announcement of his death gave me a great shock. Your
      father was a good man, Randulph&mdash;a good man, and a kind one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He was, indeed, sir,&rsquo; rejoined the young man, in a broken voice, the
      tears starting to his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But somewhat careless in money matters, Randulph&mdash;thoughtless and
      extravagant,&rsquo; pursued the miser. &lsquo;Nay, I mean nothing disrespectful to his
      memory,&rsquo; he added, seeing the young man&rsquo;s colour heighten. &lsquo;His faults
      were those of an over-generous nature. He was no man&rsquo;s enemy but his own.
      He once had a fine property, but I fear he dissipated it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At all events, he greatly embarrassed it, sir,&rsquo; replied Randulph; &lsquo;and I
      lament to say that the situation of his affairs preyed upon his spirits,
      and no doubt hastened his end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feared it would be so,&rsquo; said the miser, shaking his head. &lsquo;But the
      estates were entailed. They are yours now, and unembarrassed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They might have been so, sir,&rsquo; replied the young man; &lsquo;but I have
      foregone the advantage I could have taken of my father&rsquo;s creditors, and
      have placed the estates in their hands, and for their benefit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say you have been guilty of such incredible folly, for
      I can call it nothing else?&rsquo; cried the miser in a sharp and angry tone,
      and starting to his feet. What! give the estates to the very men who
      ruined your father! Have you been rash and unadvised enough to break down
      the barriers the law had built around you for your protection, and let in
      the enemy into the very heart of the citadel? It is the height of folly&mdash;of
      madness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Folly or not, sir,&rsquo; returned the young man haughtily, &lsquo;I do not repent
      the step I have taken. Mv first consideration was to preserve the memory
      of my father unblemished.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unblemished!&mdash;pshaw!&rsquo; cried the miser. &lsquo;You would have cleared the
      spots from your father&rsquo;s name much more effectually if you had kept fast
      hold of the estates, instead of reducing yourself to the condition of a
      beggar.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father!&rsquo; exclaimed Hilda uneasily&mdash;&lsquo;father, you speak too strongly&mdash;much
      too strongly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am no beggar, sir,&rsquo; replied Randulph, with difficulty repressing his
      anger, &lsquo;nor will I allow such a term to be applied to me by you or any
      man. Farewell, sir.&rsquo; And he would have left the room, if he had not been
      detained by the imploring looks of Hilda.

      <span class="head">RANDULPH CREW INTRODUCED TO BEAU VILLIERS ON THE MALL&mdash;ST.
      JAMES&rsquo;S PARK</span>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>andulph and his
      two uncles sallied forth, and, crossing Westminster Bridge, shaped their
      course towards Saint James&rsquo;s Park. As they passed the Little Sanctuary,
      Randulph could not help gazing towards the dungeon-like dwelling which
      enshrined her who had made so deep an impression upon him. Uncle Abel
      noticed his look, and partly divining the cause of it, said,
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Remember what I told you. Disobey me, and you will rue it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Randulph would have made some reply, but he was checked by a significant
      glance from uncle Trussell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Passing through the Gate House, they entered the park by a small doorway
      at the end of Prince&rsquo;s Court. It was now noon, and a warm and genial day.
      The avenues of trees then extending between this point and Rosamond&rsquo;s Pond
      were crowded with persons of both sexes, and of all ranks, summoned forth
      by the fineness of the weather.
    </p>
    <p>
      Amused by the scene, Randulph gazed with much curiosity at all presented
      to his view. Passing by the Decoy, the party skirted the great canal, and
      leaving Rosamond&rsquo;s Pond on the left, proceeded towards Buckingham House.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just at this juncture, uncle Trussell caught sight of a gay party
      approaching, and exclaimed, in a joyful tone, to his nephew, &lsquo;As I live,
      we are most fortunate! There is the leader of fashion, Beau Villiers,
      coming towards us. You shall know him, nephew&mdash;you shall know him.
      The ladies he is walking with are Lady Brabazon and the Honourable
      Clementina Brabazon&mdash;a fine girl, Clementina&mdash;a remarkably fine
      girl; perfect in style and manners&mdash;quite a toast among the sparks.
      The old fellow at her side, Sir Singleton Spinke, was a great beau in his
      time, though never equal to Villiers, who far surpasses even his
      prototype, Beau Fielding, in style and taste. You shall know them all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And nice acquaintances you will make!&rsquo; remarked uncle Abel sneeringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never mind him, Randulph,&rsquo; whispered uncle Trussell. &lsquo;If you know this
      set, and they like you, you may know whom you please. Beau Villiers
      commands all society, from the highest down to&mdash;to&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">RANDULPH CREW INTRODUCED TO BEAU VILLIERS ON THE MALL&mdash;ST.
      JAMES&rsquo;S PARK</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Trussell Beechcroft,&rsquo; replied uncle Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, down to me, if you please,&rsquo; rejoined uncle Trussell, &lsquo;and that
      shows it does not extend too low. But, Randulph, I beg you to look at the
      beau. Did you ever see a finer man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is very handsome, certainly,&rsquo; replied Randulph, &lsquo;and remarkably well
      dressed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is a great coxcomb, a great rake, and a great gamester, Randulph,&rsquo; 
      said uncle Abel; &lsquo;beware of him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tush, never mind what he says,&rsquo; rejoined uncle Trussell, who really
      wished to have the éclat of introducing his handsome nephew to the beau.
      &lsquo;Come along!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he took his nephew&rsquo;s arm and hurried him forward. Pushing their
      way through the throng, they soon approached the sentry-box opposite
      Buckingham House, near which they encountered the party in question.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beau Villiers, who was, indeed, a remarkably handsome man, and dressed in
      the extremity of the mode, wore an embossed velvet coat, embroidered with
      silver, with broad cuffs similarly ornamented; a white waistcoat of the
      richest silk, likewise heed with silver; and tawny velvet breeches, partly
      covered with pearl-coloured silk hose, drawn above the knee, and secured
      with silver garters. His dress was completed by shoes of black Spanish
      leather, fastened by large diamond buckles, and a superb Ramillies periwig
      of the lightest flaxen hair, which set off his brilliant complexion and
      fine eyes to admiration. He carried a three-cornered hat, fringed with
      feathers, and a clouded cane, mounted with a valuable pebble.
    </p>
    <p>
      Near the beau walked Lady Brabazon, a gorgeous dame of about
      five-and-forty, and still possessed of great personal attractions, which
      she omitted no means of displaying. She wore a hoop, and a blue and silver
      satin sack. Struck by Randulph&rsquo;s figure at a distance, she had pointed him
      out to the beau, who thereupon vouchsafed to look towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Behind Lady Brabazon came her daughter, Clementina, a very pretty and very
      affected blonde of two-and-twenty, with an excessively delicate
      complexion, fair hair, summer blue eyes, and a very mincing gait. She was
      exquisitely dressed in the last new mode, with a small escalloped lace
      cap, her hair crisply curled at the sides, a triple row of pearls round
      her neck, and a diamond cross attached to the chain; and though she
      pretended to be interested in the discourse of the old knight, it was
      evident her regards were attracted by the handsome young stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to the old beau, he was, indeed, supremely ridiculous. He was attired
      in a richly embroidered cinnamon-coloured velvet coat, with fur cuffs of a
      preposterous size, each as large as a modern muff. His pantaloon legs were
      covered with pink silk hose; his wrinkled features were rouged and
      bepatched; and his wig was tied with a large bow, and had such an immense
      queue to it, that it looked as if a Patagonian dragon-fly had perched on
      the back of his neck. Lady Brabazon was attended by a little black page,
      in a turban and eastern dress, who had charge of her favourite lap-nile.
      Uncle Abel drew on one side to allow the introduction to take place, and
      to witness it, uncle Trussell stepped forward, and bowing obsequiously to
      Beau Villiers, pointed to Randulph, &lsquo;Permit me,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;to introduce my
      nephew, Mr. Randulph Crew, to you, Mr. Villiers. He is fresh from the
      country. But even there, your reputation has reached him.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am happy to make his acquaintance,&rsquo; replied the beau, courteously
      returning Randulph&rsquo;s bow, and eyeing him curiously at the same time. &lsquo;On
      my faith, your ladyship,&rsquo; he added aloud to Lady Brabazon, &lsquo;the young man
      is not amiss, but destroyed by his wretched equipments and rustic air.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I really think something may be made of him,&rsquo; returned Lady Brabazon, in
      the same loud and confidential tone. &lsquo;Mr. Trussell Beechcroft, introduce
      your nephew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the greatest pleasure, your ladyship,&rsquo; replied Trussell, obeying her
      behest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come with us,&rsquo; said Lady Brabazon to Randulph, after the ceremony had
      been gone through. &lsquo;My daughter&mdash;Mr. Crew,&rsquo; she added, as they passed
      along. &lsquo;By the bye, who was that strange old man I saw walking with you
      just now?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who?&rsquo; rejoined Randulph evasively, for he felt ashamed, he knew not why,
      of acknowledging his uncle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There he is,&rsquo; said Lady Brabazon, pointing her fan backwards; &lsquo;he is
      staring hard at us, and looks exactly like a&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is my uncle Abel,&rsquo; replied Randulph, in some confusion. &lsquo;Your uncle
      Abel!&rsquo; cried Lady Brabazon, with a scream of who stood on his right. &lsquo;Then
      the sooner you get rid of uncle Abel the better.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel could not hear the words, but he heard the laugh, saw the gesture, as
      well as his nephew&rsquo;s confusion, and knew that he was the object of it. He
      turned away in the opposite direction, muttering to himself as he went,
      &lsquo;So, he has taken the first step.&rsquo;

      the cellar. The summons not being answered as expeditiously as he desired,
      he called again, and Jacob made his appearance brushing the moisture from
      his lips, and trying to swallow down a huge morsel that stuck in his
      throat.

      &lsquo;What&rsquo;s that to you, sirrah?&rsquo; rejoined the miser, with more anger in his
      words than in his tones or looks. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll tell you thus much, I never in
      my life wished a day to be passed so much as I do this.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You excite my curiosity, father,&rsquo; said Hilda. &lsquo;Why do you wish it
      passed?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, if a certain sum of money is not paid to me before six o&rsquo;clock,
      I shall be the possessor of one of the finest estates in Wales,&rsquo; replied
      the miser. &lsquo;It must now be five; in another hour I shall be safe&mdash;safe,
      Hilda!&mdash;the mortgage will be foreclosed&mdash;the estate, mine! Mr.
      Diggs will be here at six. If I obtain this prize, Jacob, you shall drink
      my health in the glass of wine I put back in the bottle.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then it&rsquo;ll be the first time I ever so drunk it,&rsquo; replied Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take care it isn&rsquo;t the last, you thankless varlet,&rsquo; rejoined the miser.
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t stand chattering there! Go and see what&rsquo;s o&rsquo;clock.&rsquo; As Jacob
      departed to obey his injunction, Mr. Scarve paced to and fro within the
      room, rubbing his hands and chuckling to himself. Five minutes nearly
      elapsed before Jacob returned; and when he did so, it was with a
      countenance of very peculiar significance. &lsquo;Well, is it five?&rsquo; cried the
      miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, it&rsquo;s fourteen,&rsquo; replied Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fourteen!&rsquo; exclaimed the miser. &lsquo;What do you mean? You&rsquo;re drunk, sirrah&mdash;drunk
      on the promise of a glass of wine.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, I&rsquo;m not,&rsquo; replied Jacob. &lsquo;I mean that there is a troop of fourteen
      horsemen at the door. There!&mdash;don&rsquo;t you hear&rsquo;em? They make noise
      enough, I should think.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And as he spoke, a loud knocking, mixed with shouts and laughter, came
      sounding down the passage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is the mortgage money, father,&rsquo; said Hilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is&mdash;damnation!&rsquo; cried the miser, stamping on the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At first I took the troop for a gang of highwaymen,&rsquo; said Jacob, &lsquo;when
      their leader, a fat, bloated old fellow, calls out to me, in an imperious
      tone, &ldquo;Tell your master, the miser,&rdquo; says he, &ldquo;that Sir Bulkeley Price has
      brought him his money. He is not yet owner of an estate in Flintshire.&rdquo;
       And then all his followers burst out a laughin&rsquo;; and I don&rsquo;t think they&rsquo;ve
      done yet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curses on them!&rsquo; cried the miser furiously, &lsquo;and on him too! They shan&rsquo;t
      enter my dwelling. I won&rsquo;t receive the money. Send them away! Tell them
      I&rsquo;m not at home, Jacob.&rsquo; &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do, sir,&rsquo; replied Jacob; &lsquo;they know
      you&rsquo;re at home, for I told&rsquo;em so. And as to refusing the money, why should
      you do that? They have brought it in great bags&mdash;bags of gold, of
      five hundred pounds each.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Five hundred devils!&rsquo; cried the miser, foaming with rage. &lsquo;What! bring
      such a sum as that in broad day! I shall be exposed to all my prying
      neighbours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you will,&rsquo; rejoined Jacob; &lsquo;they&rsquo;re all at the windows looking on.
      There&rsquo;s Mr. Deacle, the mercer, over the way, and his wife and daughter;
      and the inquisitive little barber next door; and the ironmonger&rsquo;s wife and
      family at the Blackamoor&rsquo;s Head; and the vintner&rsquo;s at the Man-in-the-Moon,
      and&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your peace,&rsquo; cried the miser furiously, &lsquo;or I&rsquo;ll strangle you! I&rsquo;ll
      not be insulted thus by any man! Fetch me my sword!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Father!&rsquo; exclaimed Hilda, &lsquo;why do you excite yourself thus? Sir Bulkeley
      Price has but done what was right; he has brought you back your money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">SIR BULKELEY PRICE BRINGING THE MORTGAGE MONEY TO MR.
      SCARVE</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is it o&rsquo;clock, Jacob?&mdash;did you ascertain that?&rsquo; cried the
      miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not five, sir,&mdash;not five,&rsquo; replied Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! perdition seize him! he is in time,&rsquo; cried the miser. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll be
      revenged. I&rsquo;ll have his blood if I can&rsquo;t have the estate. My sword, Jacob!
      What! you won&rsquo;t move? Nay, then, I&rsquo;ll fetch it myself.&rsquo; And opening a side
      door, he rushed up a small flight of steps leading to his bedroom.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Some mischief will happen, Jacob,&rsquo; cried Hilda, with a terrified look. &lsquo;I
      never saw my father so agitated before. I&rsquo;ll go forth myself, and entreat
      Sir Bulkeley to depart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t expose yourself to the insults of his servants, miss,&rsquo; rejoined
      Jacob. &lsquo;I did not tell master a quarter what they said of him.&rsquo; But
      despite his entreaties, and those of her aunt, who also endeavoured to
      detain her, she rushed forth, followed by Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      On gaining the street, Hilda found Jacob&rsquo;s statement perfectly correct. A
      troop of fourteen horsemen, with Sir Bulkeley Price at their head, were
      drawn up in front of the house. Most of them were well mounted, though a
      few of the number rode stout Welsh ponies. All had swords at their sides,
      and pistols in their holsters, as was needful from the amount of money
      they carried; every man having been provided with two bags, each
      containing five hundred pounds in gold, slung over his saddle-bow. A pile
      of these precious sacks lay at the door, and some of the men were now
      adding to the heap, while others were unslinging bags from their comrades&rsquo; 
      saddles. The whole company were in high glee, and laughing loudly. The
      leader of the troop, Sir Bulkeley Price, was a stout portly gentleman,
      whose swollen, inflamed cheeks and mulberry nose showed he was by no means
      indifferent to the pleasures of the table. A claret-coloured velvet
      riding-coat, buttoned to the throat, displayed his full chest and rather
      commanding figure to advantage; while a well-powdered, full-bottomed
      periwig contrasted strongly with his rubicund and fiery visage. Hilda&rsquo;s
      appearance created a great sensation among the lookers-on, and especially
      attracted the attention of the barber, who was chattering with Mr. Deacle
      about the occurrence, and of the fair Thomasine, who was leaning out of an
      upper window, just above her father&rsquo;s sign of the Three Pigeons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s Miss Scarve!&rsquo; cried Peter, calling to Thomasine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see her,&rsquo; replied the mercer&rsquo;s daughter. &lsquo;Poor thing, how I pity her&mdash;to
      be exposed to such insults! I long to fly to her assistance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do, do!&rsquo; cried Peter. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll fly with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, don&rsquo;t,&rsquo; said Mr. Deacle; &lsquo;you had better not interfere. Lord bless
      me! I wonder what it all means?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Heedless of what was passing around her, for she heard her father&rsquo;s
      furious voice in the passage, Hilda rushed toward Sir Bulkeley Price, and,
      in a tone of the most earnest entreaty, cried, &lsquo;Oh, sir, I implore you to
      go away! My father is fearfully incensed&mdash;some mischief will happen!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are Mr. Scarve&rsquo;s daughter, I presume?&rsquo; returned Sir Bulkeley,
      politely taking off his hat. &lsquo;I should never have suspected him of owning
      aught so beautiful. But why should I go away, Miss Scarve? I am merely
      come to pay your father a sum of money which I borrowed from him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is the manner of paying it, sir,&mdash;the public manner&mdash;the
      exposure that incenses him,&rsquo; cried Hilda. &lsquo;I would not for twice the
      amount, that this had happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I daresay not,&rsquo; replied Sir Bulkeley; &lsquo;but your father has forced me into
      the measure. My estate would have been forfeited if I had not repaid the
      money by six o&rsquo;clock. It is as unpleasant to me as it can be to him; but I
      had no alternative.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a loud angry cry was heard at the door, and the miser
      appeared, brandishing his drawn sword at it. His mad career was opposed by
      Jacob, whose wig was knocked off in his endeavours to push him backwards.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Villain!&rsquo; cried the miser, shaking his hand at Sir Bulkeley, &lsquo;villain,
      you shall repent your insolence! Release me, Jacob! Let me get at him!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, you shan&rsquo;t!&rsquo; replied Jacob, who had to exert all his strength, such
      was the miser&rsquo;s fury, to keep him back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Scarve&rsquo;s vociferations of rage were now drowned by the hootings and
      jeers of the Welsh baronet&rsquo;s attendants, who did all in their power to
      incense him further. Terrified by the cries, Hilda clasped her hands in
      agony, and again addressed herself to Sir Bulkeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you are a gentleman, sir, I beseech you to withdraw,&rsquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Such an appeal, and from such lips, is irresistible,&rsquo; replied Sir
      Bulkeley, again raising his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is no gentleman, Hilda!&rsquo; shrieked her father, who overheard what was
      said. &lsquo;Come away, girl, I command you&mdash;leave him to me!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well crowed, old cock!&rsquo; cried one of the attendants, in mockery. And all
      laughed jeeringly, as before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hold your tongues, you saucy knaves!&rsquo; cried Jacob, fiercely regarding
      them; &lsquo;or as soon as I&rsquo;m at liberty, I&rsquo;ll break some of your addle pates.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For pity&rsquo;s sake&mdash;go, go!&rsquo; cried Hilda to the baronet, &lsquo;and take the
      money with you. Another time will do for payment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me, Miss Scarve,&rsquo; replied Sir Bulkeley; &lsquo;another time will <i>not</i>
      do. I mustn&rsquo;t jeopardise my estate. Mr. Scarve,&rsquo; he shouted to the miser,
      &lsquo;here is your money&mdash;fourteen thousand pounds, in gold. Friends,&rsquo; he
      added, looking round at the crowd of spectators in the street, and at the
      windows, &lsquo;I call you all to witness that this money is paid before six
      o&rsquo;clock. I will take your word, Miss Scarve, for a receipt, and for the
      delivering up of the mortgage deeds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take hence your money, villain!&rsquo; vociferated the miser, &lsquo;I want none of
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This exclamation was followed by a roar of derisive laughter from the
      baronet&rsquo;s attendants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence them&mdash;oh! silence them, sir!&rsquo; cried Hilda imploringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Bulkeley looked majestically round, and his attendants became
      instantly mute. At the same time, Jacob forced Mr. Scarve into the house;
      and Hilda, hastily expressing her thanks to the baronet, withdrew. In a
      few seconds, the whole of the bags of money were collected, and placed on
      the threshold. Sir Bulkeley would not, however, depart till Jacob
      returned, when he committed the heap to his custody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What have you done with your master?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has fainted, and his daughter is tending him,&rsquo; replied Jacob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, take him that restorative,&rsquo; rejoined Sir Bulkeley, pointing to the
      money-bags; &lsquo;it will speedily revive him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he rode off with his followers, amid the acclamation of the
      spectators. The same persons next began to hoot Jacob, and even seemed
      disposed to assail him; but being now provided with his crab-stick, he
      presented such a menacing and formidable appearance, that those nearest
      him slunk off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">HILDA&rsquo;S VISIT TO ABEL BEECHCROFT</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ilda yielded at
      length to her aunt&rsquo;s entreaties, and having put on her walking attire,
      quitted the house with Jacob. Instead of going over Westminster Bridge,
      they proceeded to Parliament Stairs, where Jacob said he had a friend a
      waterman, who would lend him a boat, in which they could cross the river.
      Nor did he assert more than the truth. On reaching the stairs, the first
      person he encountered was the friendly waterman in question, who, on
      learning his wishes, immediately ran down and got his skiff ready. Having
      placed Hilda within it, Jacob took off his coat, and plying the oars with
      as much skill as the best rower on the Thames could have done, speedily
      landed her at Lambeth, and secured the boat, where he inquired the way to
      Mr. Beechcroft&rsquo;s house. A walk of a few seconds brought them to it.
      Hilda&rsquo;s heart trembled as she knocked at the door; but she was reassured
      by the kindly aspect of Mr. Jukes, who answered the summons. She stated
      her errand to the butler, who appeared not a little surprised, and,
      indeed, confounded, at the announcement of her name. After a short debate
      with himself, Mr. Jukes said his master was at home, and she should see
      him; and, without more ado, he led the way to the library, and entered it,
      followed by the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel was seated beside an old-fashioned bookcase, the door of which was
      open, disclosing a collection of goodly tomes, and had placed the
      book-stand, supporting the volume he was reading, in such a position as to
      receive the full light of the window. So much was he engaged in his
      studies that he did not hear their approach. In the hasty glance cast by
      Hilda at the pictures on the wall, the most noticeable of which was a copy
      of Rembrandt&rsquo;s &lsquo;Good Samaritan,&rsquo; and a fine painting on the subject of
      &lsquo;Timon of Athens,&rsquo; she thought she could read somewhat of the character of
      the owner of the house. Little time, however, was allowed her for
      reflection, for Mr. Jukes, advancing towards his master&rsquo;s chair, leaned
      over it, and whispered a few words in his ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&mdash;who!&mdash;who did you say?&rsquo; exclaimed Abel, half-closing the
      book he was reading, and looking sharply and anxiously round. &lsquo;Who did you
      say, Jukes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Scarve, sir,&rsquo; replied the butler; &lsquo;she has brought you a letter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell her I won&rsquo;t receive it&mdash;won&rsquo;t open it!&rsquo; cried Abel. &lsquo;Why did you
      not send her away? What brings her here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better put that question to her yourself, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr.
      Jukes, &lsquo;for she is in this room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here!&rsquo; exclaimed Abel, starting to his feet. &lsquo;Ah! I see&mdash;I see. O
      God! she is very like her mother.&rsquo; 
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Calm yourself, I entreat, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Jukes; &lsquo;I would not have
      admitted her,&rsquo; he added, in a low tone, &lsquo;but that she told me the letter
      was written by her mother, and left to be delivered to you under peculiar
      circumstances, which have now arisen. I couldn&rsquo;t resist a plea like that&mdash;nor
      could you, sir, I&rsquo;m sure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A letter written to me by her mother! cried Abel, shivering, as if
      smitten by an ague. &lsquo;Leave us, Jukes, and take that man with you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, friend,&rsquo; said Mr. Jukes to Jacob, who, with his crab-stick under
      his arm, stood gazing curiously on, &lsquo;you had better adjourn with me to the
      butler&rsquo;s pantry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thank&rsquo;ee kindly, sir,&rsquo; replied Jacob, in tones a little less gruff than
      usual, for he was somewhat awestricken; &lsquo;I would rather stay with my young
      missis.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But don&rsquo;t you see you&rsquo;re in the way, my good man?&rsquo; rejoined Mr. Jukes
      impatiently; &lsquo;they can&rsquo;t talk before us. Come along.&rsquo; And despite his
      resistance, he pushed Jacob out of the room, and closed the door after
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a letter for me, young lady, I believe,&rsquo; faltered Abel in a
      voice hollow and broken by emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have, sir,&rsquo; she replied, giving it to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel looked at the address, and another sharp convulsion passed over his
      frame. He, however, controlled himself by a powerful effort, and broke the
      seal. The perusal of the letter seemed to affect him deeply, for,
      staggering to his chair, he sank into it, and covering his face with his
      hands, wept aloud. It was some minutes before he arose. Hilda, who had
      watched him with much concern, was surprised to see how calm he looked. He
      had, indeed, regained the mastery he usually held over his feelings. &lsquo;Pray
      be seated, young lady,&rsquo; he said, handing her a chair. &lsquo;I would have
      shunned this interview if it had been in my power, but as it has been
      brought about, I will not shrink from it. How can I serve you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hilda then proceeded to explain the object of her visit. Abel listened to
      her recital with a quivering lip and flashing eye, and at its close got
      up, and took a quick turn round the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is only what might be expected from him&mdash;scoundrel!&rsquo; he
      ejaculated. &lsquo;Sell his daughter!&mdash;but that is nothing&mdash;he would
      sell his soul for gold! I beg your pardon, young lady,&rsquo; he added, checking
      himself, as he saw the pain his exclamations occasioned her, &lsquo;but if you
      knew the deep and irremediable injury inflicted on me by your father, you
      would pardon this outbreak of passion. He has sacrificed others without
      scruple, but he shall not sacrifice you. You may count on my assistance,
      my protection, if you choose to confide in me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have my mother&rsquo;s injunction to confide in you, sir,&rsquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your mother!&rsquo; exclaimed Abel, in a voice of agony. &lsquo;Oh, Hilda! what a
      fearful spell is there in that word!&mdash;what a host of feelings does it
      not summon up! I see your mother again as I remember her in her youth&mdash;beautiful
      as you are, more beautiful, if possible&mdash;certainly more blooming. I
      hear the music of her voice as I listen to yours; I feel again the charm
      inspired by her presence. You shall learn my history one of these days,
      and you will then know why your mother addressed this letter to me&mdash;why
      it affects me thus.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can partly guess the cause,&rsquo; returned Hilda mournfully; &lsquo;but be it what
      it may, it is plain she felt she had a strong hold on your affections, and
      that she thought she could rely on you, when she could rely on no one
      else.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If she thought so, she judged rightly,&rsquo; replied Abel. &lsquo;I consider her
      request as a sacred injunction, and will strive to comply with it. And
      now,&rsquo; he added, changing his tone, &lsquo;I must tell you that your name has
      been brought before me of late. My nephew, Randulph Crew, who visited your
      father the other night, has spoken of you.&rsquo; Hilda slightly coloured. &lsquo;He
      will much regret not being at home this morning,&rsquo; pursued Abel, &lsquo;as he
      might have had an opportunity of further cultivating his acquaintance with
      you. But he is gone out with my brother.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope it will not offend you to say I am glad of it,&rsquo; replied Hilda; &lsquo;I
      would not willingly have met him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why so?&rsquo; asked Abel, who, however, looked somewhat relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because, sir, I will be frank with you,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;and own that my
      father attributes my increased dislike of my cousin to a predilection for
      your nephew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And may I expect equal frankness in the reply, if I ask whether there is
      any truth in your father&rsquo;s suppositions?&rsquo; rejoined Abel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may,&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;Your nephew appears a very amiable and pleasing
      young man, but having seen him only for a few minutes, I cannot possibly
      feel an interest in him beyond such as might be inspired by any stranger
      of equally prepossessing appearance and manners. My aversion to my cousin
      arises from various causes. I half suspect him of acting a very base part
      towards my father, who resolutely shuts his eyes to the deception.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not affect to deny that I am pleased with what you say of your
      indifference to my nephew, Hilda,&rsquo; returned Abel, &lsquo;because I have other
      views in reference to him. As to your cousin, Philip Frewin, I will make
      strict inquiries about him, and if your suspicions prove correct, I will
      myself unmask him to your father, which may perhaps put an end to the
      matter. He lives in Fen-church Street, you say. It so happens that an old
      friend of mine, a widow lady, Mrs. Verrai&mdash;a friend of your mother&rsquo;s,
      by the bye&mdash;resides in that street. She is an excellent woman, but a
      little of a busy-body and a gossip, and makes it her business to know her
      neighbours&rsquo; concerns better than her own. I&rsquo;ll venture to say she is
      acquainted with your cousin&rsquo;s affairs. I haven&rsquo;t seen the old lady of
      late, because, as you may perhaps have heard, I have little intercourse
      with your sex&mdash;my habits, and indeed feelings, unfitting me for their
      society&mdash;but I happen to know from my brother Trussell that she is
      well. You had better go to her yourself. I will give you a note of
      introduction&mdash;though, indeed, it is not needed, for, as I have told
      you, she is an old friend of your mother&rsquo;s. In addition to gaining all the
      information you may require respecting your cousin, you will make a friend
      with whom you may take refuge, if matters&mdash;which we will not
      anticipate&mdash;should unhappily render such a step necessary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will do as you suggest, sir,&rsquo; replied Hilda; &lsquo;but suppose I should
      encounter my cousin?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Tell him where you are going,&rsquo; replied Abel; &lsquo;and depend upon it, if he
      is not what he represents himself, he will be the first to take the alarm.
      I will myself institute inquiries about him in another quarter.&rsquo; With
      this, he proceeded to a table on which writing materials were placed, and
      hastily penned a note, and gave it to Hilda. &lsquo;And now, God bless you, my
      dear child!&rsquo; he said affectionately. &lsquo;If called upon by circumstances, you
      shall never want a father or protector in me!&rsquo; He then rang the bell, and
      Mr. Jukes presently appeared, who informed him that Jacob had just sat
      down to dinner with the other servants.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think, sir,&rsquo; he added, in a low tone, &lsquo;it is the first good meal he has
      had for many a day, and it would be a pity to disturb him, if Miss Scarve
      is not in a very great hurry.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Abel appealed to Hilda, and as she raised no objection, he proposed to her
      to take a turn in the garden till Jacob had finished his meal; and
      accordingly opened the window and led her forth. By this time Hilda had
      become more composed, and being quite easy with the old man, for whom
      indeed she felt a growing regard, she entered readily into conversation
      with him; and thus more than half an hour flew by, almost without their
      being aware of its flight. At the end of that time, Mr. Jukes made his
      appearance, and informed them that Jacob was ready. Abel attended his fair
      visitor to the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you do not find Mrs. Verrai at home,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;or if anything should
      occur to make you wish to see me again, do not hesitate to come back. But,
      in any event, you shall hear from me&mdash;perhaps see me, to-morrow. God
      bless you, my child!&rsquo; And taking her hand, he pressed it to his lips; and
      when Hilda withdrew it, she found it wet with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Jacob shook the hospitable butler warmly by the
      hand, and then strode on before his young mistress, towards the stairs
      where he had left the boat. Having placed her within it, and divested
      himself of his coat and hat, as before, he inquired where she meant to go,
      and being told to London Bridge, pulled off vigorously in that direction.

      <span class="head">&lsquo;THE FOLLY&rsquo;&mdash;A FLOATING TAVERN ON THE THAMES&mdash;KITTY
      CONWAY&mdash;RANDULPH PLACED IN AN AWKWARD SITUATION BY PHILIP FREWIN</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Folly on the
      Thames, whither Beau Villiers and his party were steering their course,
      was a large floating house of entertainment, moored in the centre of the
      stream, immediately opposite old Somerset House. It was constructed in the
      latter part of the reign of Charles the Second; and thither the merry
      monarch, who was excessively fond of aquatic amusements of all kinds,
      would frequently repair with his courtiers and frolic dames. Thither also
      Queen Mary, the consort of William the Third, went on the occasion of a
      grand musical entertainment; and the place continued in vogue for many
      years, until at length, degenerating in its character, it became the haunt
      of a very disreputable part of the community. The Folly resembled a large
      one-storied house, very long in proportion to its width, built upon an
      immense barge. There was a platform at the top, defended by a strong
      wooden balustrade, and flanked at each corner by a little turret with a
      pointed top, surmounted by a small streamer. These turrets constituted
      small drinking and smoking rooms, and were fitted up with seats and
      tables. In the centre of the structure was a sort of open belvidere,
      covering the main staircase leading to the roof. On this a large flag was
      planted. The Folly was approached from the water by steps on three sides.
      It was lighted by a range of large and handsome windows, and entered by
      two doors, one at the end, and the other at the side. Within, it contained
      a long music-hall with a frescoed ceiling, gilded and painted walls, an
      orchestra, and the necessary complement of benches, chairs, and small
      tables. There was, moreover, a bar, where all sorts of liquors, materials
      for smoking, and other tavern luxuries were dispensed. The rest of the
      structure was divided into a number of small apartments for private
      parties, and, in short, boasted every sort of accommodation afforded by a
      similar place of entertainment on shore. In summer it was delightful&mdash;the
      view of the Thames from its summit being enchanting. The coolness and
      freshness, combined with the enlivening influences of beauty, wine, and
      music, made it, on its first establishment, a charming place of
      recreation; and it cannot be wondered that the merry monarch, and his
      merrier court, found it so much to their taste.

    </h5>
    <p>
      As the party approached the aquatic hotel, they perceived a number of
      persons, of both sexes, seated on the roof, and in the little turret
      parlours, smoking, drinking, or otherwise amusing themselves; while lively
      strains of music proceeded from within. Several small craft were landing
      their passengers, and from one, a tilt boat, there issued a very pretty
      young woman, though of rather bold appearance, who, as she took the hand
      of a young man in her ascent of the steps, displayed a remarkably neat
      foot and ankle. On reaching the deck, she turned for a moment to survey
      the scene, and her eye alighting on Randulph, his good looks appeared to
      rivet her regards.
    </p>
    <p>
      This fascinating creature seemed to be about twenty; had very regular
      features, auburn hair, a brilliant complexion&mdash;whether wholly
      unindebted to art might be questioned&mdash;but there could be no question
      as to the natural brilliancy of her hazel eyes; and wore a pink silk
      hooped gown, made very low in front, so as to display her beautifully
      formed and radiantly white neck and shoulders. Her sleeves were very
      short, probably so contrived with the view of exhibiting her rounded arms,
      and edged with lace. A white silk apron embroidered with silver, a pretty
      fly-cap, and a necklace of precious stones, from which depended a diamond
      cross, completed her attire. The young man, by whom she was attended, had
      a slight thin figure, and sharp, disagreeable features, with rather an
      apish expression. He was dressed with much smartness, but had by no means
      the air of a gentleman, and seemed to be regarded with indifference,
      almost amounting to contempt, by his female companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is that young lady?&rsquo; asked Randulph of Sir Singleton, who happened to
      sit next him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let me see!&rsquo; exclaimed the old beau, placing his glass to his eye. &lsquo;Ah!
      gadzooks! &rsquo;tis the delicious creature I mentioned to you&mdash;the little
      Haymarket actress, Kitty Conway!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Kitty Conway! where is she?&rsquo; cried Trussell, who heard the remark, but
      whose back was towards the object of their admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Singleton pointed her out, and upon the instant every eye was directed
      towards her. Whether unable to stand so fierce a fire, or whether, as is
      more probable, dragged away by her companion, who did not appear to relish
      the notice she attracted, it is needless to inquire, but pretty Kitty
      suddenly vanished from their sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t she delicious?&rsquo; cried Trussell to Randulph. &lsquo;Egad! you have
      made a conquest of pretty Kitty, my boy. I saw the parting glance she gave
      you over her shoulder as she whisked through the door. Don&rsquo;t lose sight of
      her. You can soon put the City beau, by whom she is attended, <i>hors de
      combat</i>.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Further remarks were interrupted by the arrival of the boat at the steps.
      A strange black-muzzled fellow, in a Guernsey shirt, with bare arms and
      bare legs, and who was a regular attendant at the Folly, helped them to
      disembark; and his request to &lsquo;be remembered&rsquo; by the beau being met with a
      very munificent rejoinder, he well-nigh lost his balance in his glee, and
      got a tumble into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party then entered the music-hall, and just as they passed through the
      door, Randulph, chancing to look behind him, perceived that the stranger
      had likewise landed, and was mounting the steps. The novel scene, however,
      before him, so completely engrossed his attention, that he could think of
      little else. Upwards of a hundred persons of both sexes thronged the room;
      many of the ladies were masked, and a good deal of freedom marked their
      conduct. They talked and laughed loudly and recklessly. At one end of the
      hall, the benches were taken aside to allow Kitty Conway and her
      companion, with some other couples, to perform the cushion dance. At the
      upper end of the room stood the musicians. The party made their way
      towards the dancers, and the beau and Sir Singleton praised Kitty&rsquo;s beauty
      in tones so loud, and in terms of admiration so strong, as would have
      occasioned confusion to any young lady troubled with a more oppressive
      sense of bashfulness than she was. Her partner did not know whether to
      look pleased or annoyed. He was evidently overpowered by the presence of
      Beau Villiers, whom he regarded with a species of awe; and as these
      applauses of Kitty gave a fancied consequence to himself, he was weak
      enough to be gratified by them. Towards the close of the figure, a
      particular step, executed by the pretty actress, elicited more than usual
      rapture from Sir Singleton, and he called to Randulph&mdash;&lsquo;Look at her,
      Mr. Randulph Crew. Is it not delicious?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the sound of this name, Kitty&rsquo;s partner started, and stared so hard at
      Randulph, that he could scarcely finish the dance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my word, Philip Frewin, you are a very stupid partner,&rsquo; said the
      actress to him. &lsquo;If you do not exert yourself more, I shall ask that
      handsome young fellow, who is ogling me there, to take my hand in the next
      set.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite fatigued, Kitty,&rsquo; replied Philip confusedly; &lsquo;let us have some
      refreshment&mdash;a little rack punch, or a glass of champagne.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Kitty Conway assented, and they moved off to one of the side tables, where
      a waiter speedily placed glasses before them, and opened a bottle of
      champagne. It must be confessed&mdash;unwilling as we are to admit it&mdash;that
      Randulph was not altogether proof against the undisguised admiration of
      the pretty actress, and that he could not help returning the tender
      glances she shot towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the performances went forward; an Irish jig followed, in which
      Randulph and Sir Singleton joined; this was succeeded by some comic songs;
      and Mr. Villiers, who did not altogether relish the entertainment, walked
      forth, and was soon after followed by the others. As they all stood
      leaning over the sides of the bark, laughing at what had occurred, and
      admiring the gaiety of the scene, a skiff, impelled by a vigorous rower,
      as was evident by the progress it made, and containing a young female,
      wrapped in a black silk scarf, and with raven tresses, scarcely covered by
      a small bonnet, floating in the breeze, rapidly neared them. Various
      speculations were put forth as to whether this young female would prove as
      pretty on a nearer inspection as she looked at a distance; but in these
      Randulph took little part. To speak truth, his thoughts were running upon
      the fair syren within, and happening to cast his eyes towards the platform
      above, he perceived, leaning over the balustrade, and gazing at him, the
      stranger!
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, Philip Frewin came forth, to see whether his boat was in
      readiness, and admonished the watermen, one of whom was philandering with
      a buxom damsel, who was leaning over the side of the deck, that he should
      start immediately. He had scarcely, however, issued the order, than his
      eye fell upon the skiff containing the young female before mentioned, and
      which was now close at hand. He started as if an apparition had met his
      gaze, ducked down, and would have made his escape into the music-hall, if
      Kitty Conway had not placed herself in his way. Retreat was now
      impossible, and Philip&rsquo;s distress was heightened by the fair actress, who
      exclaimed, somewhat pettishly, &lsquo;Why do you leave me here, sir? Why don&rsquo;t
      you hand me to the boat?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Philip was almost at his wits&rsquo; end. The skiff containing Hilda and Jacob&mdash;both
      of whom he had too clearly recognised, though he could not account for
      their appearance, unless it were a trick of the fiend to convict him&mdash;was
      so near, that if he complied with Kitty&rsquo;s request, discovery would be
      inevitable. A plan suddenly occurred to him, by which he hoped to free
      himself from risk, and place Randulph, whom he had reason to regard as a
      rival, in an awkward dilemma. Without apprising Kitty of his intention, he
      drew her forward, and bending down as low as he could to elude
      observation, said to Randulph&mdash;&lsquo;Will you have the kindness, sir, to
      hand this lady into her boat? You will do me an infinite favour; I have
      dropped a pocket-book in the music-hall, and must go back to search for
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Randulph was a good deal surprised by the proposal, but he unhesitatingly
      consented; and, taking Kitty&rsquo;s hand, which she very graciously accorded,
      rewarding his attention by a slight squeeze, led her down the steps. All
      this occurred to the infinite amusement of Trussell, who stood a little
      back near the door, ogling a rather pretty damsel, and to the no slight
      chagrin of Sir Singleton, who, guessing the intention of Philip Frewin,
      had pushed forward to offer his services, but found himself supplanted.
      But these were not the only witnesses of the scene. By this time, the
      skiff-, containing Hilda, had come up, and with a pang of jealous feeling,
      neither to be accounted for nor controlled, she beheld Randulph handing
      the pretty actress, whose character she could scarcely mistake, down the
      steps. Jacob saw what was passing as well as herself, but, having no
      jealousy to divert his attention from other matters, he detected Philip
      Frewin even in his disguise, and, resting on his oars, exclaimed, &lsquo;Look!
      miss, look!&mdash;there is your cousin Philip. Is that the dress he wore
      yesterday? I told master he wasn&rsquo;t what he seemed. Look at him, I say!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hilda was too much agitated to heed these exclamations. She could see
      nothing but Randulph and the pretty actress. Nor was she without
      embarrassment on her own account; for Mr. Cripps, having recognised her,
      pointed her out to his master, and the beau, being much struck with her
      beauty, favoured her with a very insolent stare. But if Randulph had been
      guilty of disloyalty towards the object of his affections, his punishment
      was not long delayed; for, as he handed Kitty into the boat, which was
      steadied by the black-muzzled Jack before mentioned, his gaze encountered
      that of Hilda, and he was instantly filled with confusion. He tried to
      disengage himself from the actress, who, however, sportively detained him,
      and, unable to retreat, he cut a most ridiculous figure. Indeed, he was a
      little relieved, though he felt how much he should sink in her esteem,
      when he saw Hilda bend forward, and order Jacob, who continued resting on
      his oars, to pass on. He continued gazing after the skiff till it was out
      of sight; but Hilda did not look back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, as Philip Frewin did not make his appearance, Kitty Conway
      became very impatient, and turning a deaf ear to all the high-flown
      compliments showered upon her by Sir Singleton Spinke, entreated Randulph
      to go and see what her friend was doing. The young man could not very well
      refuse compliance with the request, and he accordingly entered the
      music-hall, and returned in a few minutes with Philip, who, finding the
      coast clear, recovered his composure, and tendering his thanks, in a very
      abject manner, to Randulph, got into the boat with Kitty, and ordered the
      men to row to Savoy Stairs. Randulph was too angry with himself, and now
      too indifferent to the fascinations of the pretty actress, to return the
      tender glance with which she favoured him on her departure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The incident, however, afforded abundant merriment to his companions, who
      were greatly diverted by his looks, which they attributed to jealousy, and
      they endeavoured to remove the feeling by assuring him that Kitty had
      exhibited a decided preference for him. His uneasiness was not relieved by
      the admiration expressed of the miser&rsquo;s daughter by Beau Villiers, nor was
      Trussell altogether pleased to find the beau so much captivated. That
      Hilda should have passed at the precise juncture seemed to surprise
      everybody.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">RANDULPH&rsquo;S INTERVIEW WITH CARDWELL FIREBRAS IN THE
      CLOISTERS OF WESTMINSTER ABBEY</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>hortly after this,
      the party entered their boat and returned to Whitehall Stairs. Randulph
      had been so much engrossed by his own feelings, that he forgot the
      stranger, and only called him to mind a few minutes after he had landed,
      and when it was too late to look for him. He did not, however, forget his
      appointment with the writer of the mysterious letter, and, regardless of
      the construction that might be put upon it, told his uncle he had a
      particular engagement, which he must keep, at six o&rsquo;clock. Trussell smiled
      significantly at the announcement, but made no remark, and proposed that
      they should all dine at one of the French ordinaries in Suffolk Street.
      Beau Villiers pleaded an engagement, but Sir Singleton acquiesced, and the
      trio repaired to the ordinary, where an excellent dinner was set before
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mindful of his appointment, Randulph, in spite of the jokes of his
      companions, who strove to detain him, got up from table at five o&rsquo;clock,
      and took his way past Charing Cross and Whitehall towards the Abbey. He
      could not resist the impulse that prompted him to pass through the Little
      Sanctuary, and felt half-disposed to call at the miser&rsquo;s and offer some
      explanation of his conduct to Hilda. Though the absurdity of the notion
      caused him to abandon it almost as soon as formed, he lingered before the
      house for a few minutes, in the hope of discerning some of its inmates,
      but was disappointed. He then entered Peter Pokerich&rsquo;s shop, to inquire
      the way to the Abbey cloisters.
    </p>
    <p>
      It chanced that the little barber was about to take an evening stroll with
      the fair Thomasine, who was waiting for him, and he offered to show
      Randulph the way; but this the young man, who had his own reasons for not
      desiring the attendance of the inquisitive barber, declined, though in
      such a way as to excite Peter&rsquo;s curiosity, who secretly determined to
      follow him. As soon as Randulph was gone, he mentioned his design to the
      fair Thomasine, who was nothing loth to accompany him, and they set out
      together, taking special care to keep out of Randulph&rsquo;s view. The young
      man shaped his course towards the Abbey, and, skirting its western
      extremity, passed under the archway leading to the playground of
      Westminster School. Here he paused, and, addressing a porter, was directed
      towards another archway, through which he passed, and entered the
      cloisters. On seeing this, Peter, still accompanied by his fair companion,
      ran forward, and finding that Randulph was walking in the south
      ambulatory, they struck into the west, being still able to watch him
      through the open columns.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randulph, meanwhile, unconscious that he was the object of such scrutiny,
      slowly traversed the ambulatory, and, charmed with the exquisite groined
      arches of its roof, hoary with age, and the view afforded through the
      shafted windows looking into the quadrangle, of the reverend buttresses
      and of the Abbey, almost forgot the object that brought him thither. He
      was arrested at the eastern extremity by the ancient inscriptions and
      brasses, pointing out the resting-places of the old abbots, Laurentius
      Gislesbertus, and Vitalis, when a heavy footstep sounded on his ear, and
      looking up he beheld the stranger. Before he could recover his surprise at
      this unexpected apparition, the new-comer advanced towards him, and with a
      slight inclination of the head, and a singularly significant smile, said,
      &lsquo;So you have kept your appointment with me, Mr. Randulph Crew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you, then, Mr. Cardwell Firebras?&rsquo; exclaimed Randulph in surprise.

    <p>
      &lsquo;I am so called,&rsquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was little aware, sir, when I saw you this morning at the barber&rsquo;s, how
      soon and how strangely we should be brought together again,&rsquo; rejoined
      Randulph; &lsquo;but this in some measure accounts for the manner in which you
      have haunted me throughout the day. Perhaps you will now explain your
      motive for doing so, as well as for summoning me hither.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All in good time, young gentleman,&rsquo; replied Cardwell Fire-bras gravely.
      &lsquo;Before I advert to my own concerns, let me say a word on yours. Answer me
      truly&mdash;have you not conceived an affection for Hilda Scarve? Nay, you
      need not answer. Your hesitation convinces me you have. Circumstances led
      you into acting very injudiciously this morning at the Folly, and I fear
      your conduct may have produced an unfavourable impression on Hilda&rsquo;s mind,&mdash;for
      I watched her closely. But heed not this. I will set all to rights. I have
      much influence with her father. He designs her for another&mdash;the apish
      gallant of the pretty actress who fascinated you this morning. But you
      shall have her nevertheless,&mdash;on one condition.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Despite the singularity of your address, there is an earnestness in your
      manner that inspires me with confidence in you, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Randulph;
      &lsquo;the rather, that you told me this morning you were an old friend of my
      father&rsquo;s. I will freely confess to you that I am captivated by the miser&rsquo;s
      daughter, and that I would hazard much to obtain her. Now, on what
      condition do you propose to make her mine?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You shall learn presently,&rsquo; replied Firebras evasively. &lsquo;Let us take a
      turn along the cloisters,&rsquo; he added, moving slowly forward. They marched
      on together in silence until they reached the eastern angle of the
      ambulatory, when Firebras, suddenly halting, laid his heavy hand upon
      Randulph&rsquo;s arm, and fixed a searching look upon him. &lsquo;Young man,&rsquo; he said,
      &lsquo;I will tell you what you must do to gain the miser&rsquo;s daughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, what?&rsquo; demanded Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You must join the Jacobite party,&rsquo; replied Firebras; &lsquo;to which her father
      belongs&mdash;to which your father belonged&mdash;and to which your mother
      also belongs.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Surprise kept Randulph silent. But neither he nor his companion were aware
      that this treasonable proposition had been overheard by Peter Pokerich and
      the fair Thomasine, who, having stolen upon them unperceived, were
      ensconced behind the shafts of the adjoining arches.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he miser,
      meanwhile, having obtained access to his chamber, threw his hat upon the
      bed, passed on, and unlocked the door of the closet. Marching up to the
      large chest in which he had deposited the bags of gold on the previous
      night, he sat down upon it, and was for some time lost in deep and painful
      reflection. He then rose, and taking a bunch of keys from his pocket,
      applied one of them to the lock of the chest. It would not turn; and
      imagining that he must have made some mistake, he drew it out and tried
      another. This, however, did not fit at all; and returning the first, he
      perceived, on examination, that it was the right one. Again applying it,
      and proceeding more carefully, he found, to his surprise and dismay, that
      the chest was not locked. Well knowing he had not left it in this state,
      he felt convinced that something must be wrong, and it was long before he
      could prevail upon himself to raise the lid.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0007" id="linkimage-0007"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      When he did so, he started back with a cry of anguish and despair. The
      chest was empty! For some minutes he remained as if transfixed, with his
      hands stretched out, his mouth wide open, his eyes almost starting from
      their sockets, and fixed upon the void where his treasure should have
      been. At length he shrieked in accents of despair, &lsquo;I have been robbed&mdash;robbed
      of my gold!&mdash;robbed&mdash;robbed! It is a wicked thing&mdash;a cruel
      thing to rob me! Others do not love gold as I love it. I love it better
      than wife, child, mistress,&mdash;better than life itself! Would that they
      had killed me, rather than take my gold! Oh! those fair shining pieces&mdash;so
      broad, so bright, so beautiful!&mdash;what has become of them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After a pause, during which he experienced the acutest mental anguish, he
      looked around to see how the robbery could have been effected. A moment&rsquo;s
      examination showed him that the iron bars in front of the little window
      opposite the chest had been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The villains must have found entrance here!&rsquo; he cried, rushing towards
      the window. And clambering up an old oaken bureau that stood near it, he
      pushed it wide open, and stretching his long, scraggy neck through it,
      gazed into the little garden beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unable to discover anything, he drew back, and casting his eyes over the
      bureau, perceived that the dust with which it was covered had been
      slightly brushed away; but whether by himself or the depredators, it was
      now, of course, impossible to determine.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bottle standing on one corner of the bureau had not been removed. It was
      clear that the plunderers had gone direct to the chest, of which they must
      have possessed a key, for the lock, though strained, had not been forced.
      Maddened by these reflections, and unable to account for the occurrence,
      he again vented his fury in words. &lsquo;I have it!&rsquo; he shrieked, &lsquo;it is that
      accursed Welsh baronet who has robbed me. He paid me the money in this
      public way only to delude me. I&rsquo;ll charge him with the robbery&mdash;I&rsquo;ll
      prove it against him&mdash;I&rsquo;ll hang him! Oh! it would delight me to hang
      him! I would give a thousand pounds to see it done! A thousand pounds!
      What is that to the fourteen thousand I have lost? I shall go mad, and it
      were happy for me to do so. Philip Frewin will refuse to marry my
      daughter. Her portion is gone&mdash;gone! Why was I tempted forth with
      Firebras? I ought to have taken my seat on that chest&mdash;to have eaten
      my meals upon it&mdash;to have slept upon it! Night nor day should I have
      quitted it! Fool that I have been!
    </p>
    <p>
      I have been rightly served&mdash;rightly served! And yet it is hard upon
      me, an old man, to lose all I held dear&mdash;very hard!&rsquo; And falling upon
      his knees, with his hands clasped together, beside the vacant chest, he
      wept aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      This paroxysm of rage and grief having subsided, he again rose and
      descended to the parlour, where he found Mrs. Clinton anxiously waiting
      his reappearance. She instantly divined what had happened, and retreated
      before him as he advanced, almost fearing from his looks that he would do
      her a violence. Shaking his clenched hand, and foaming at the mouth, he
      attempted to discharge a volley of imprecations against her; but rage took
      away the power of speech, and he stood gesticulating and shaking before
      her&mdash;a frightful and pitiable spectacle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, sir, compose yourself,&rsquo; she cried, &lsquo;or you will have a
      fit of some dangerous illness. You terrify me to death.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad of it,&rsquo; he shrieked. &lsquo;I have been robbed&mdash;the mortgage
      money is gone&mdash;the fourteen thousand pounds. D&rsquo;ye hear, woman? I&rsquo;ve
      been robbed, I say&mdash;robbed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I feared as much,&rsquo; replied Mrs. Clinton; &lsquo;but the robbery cannot have
      been long effected, for just before you knocked at the door, I heard a
      window creak, as I thought, in your room.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You did!&rsquo; screamed the miser. &lsquo;And why did you not tell me this before? I
      might have caught them&mdash;might have got back the spoil.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you hadn&rsquo;t frightened me so much about Hilda, I should have told you,&rsquo; 
      replied Mrs. Clinton, in a deprecatory tone; &lsquo;but your violence put it out
      of my head.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hell and fiends!&rsquo; ejaculated the miser; &lsquo;what is Hilda&mdash;what are
      fifty daughters, compared with my gold? If you had enabled me to recover
      it I would have forgiven you all the rest. Don&rsquo;t stand trembling there,
      fool! but come with me, and let us see whether we can discover any traces
      of the robbers!&rsquo; So saying, he hurried towards a small back door in the
      passage, the bolts of which were so rusty that he had considerable
      difficulty in removing them; and this effected, he passed into the garden.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n about a quarter
      of an hour the landlord entered the room, and, bowing to the company,
      said, &lsquo;I believe, gentlemen, you are all assembled; the room upstairs is
      ready, if you are disposed to adjourn to it.&rsquo; The proposition being
      assented to, the landlord threw open the door, and a slight contest
      occurred between the two baronets as to which should offer the other
      precedence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I præ, Sir Bulkeley,&rsquo; said Sir Norfolk; &lsquo;I will scale the staircase after
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus exhorted, Sir Bulkeley, who thought it good breeding not to dispute a
      point of needless ceremony, went on. Sir Norfolk marched after him with
      majestic steps, and the rest of the party followed. The landlord ushered
      them into a large room, lighted by a chandelier suspended from the
      ceiling, in the centre of which was a circular table covered with bottles
      and glasses. Having hung up their hats against the wall, the company sat
      down, and a few bumpers went briskly round. While they were thus
      carousing, a tap was heard at the door, and the landlord, opening a
      reconnoitring hole within it, spoke to some one without. He next proceeded
      to convey the information he had received in a low tone, to Cardwell
      Firebras, who immediately said aloud, &lsquo;Oh, yes, admit him by all means.
      Gentlemen, a new brother!&rsquo; The door was then opened, and Randulph
      recognised in the gaily attired, self-possessed coxcomb who was admitted,
      Mr. Crackenthorpe Cripps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take a glass of wine, Mr. Cripps,&rsquo; said Firebras, filling a bumper, and
      handing it to the new-comer. &lsquo;It is Beau Villiers&rsquo;s chief valet,&rsquo; he
      added, in an undertone, to Sir Norfolk, who had made a polite though
      formal bow to the stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; exclaimed Sir Norfolk, almost shuddering at the inadvertence he
      had committed; &lsquo;a waiting-man in such costly and nitid attire. Why, his
      master, the Pretonius Arbiter of the day, can scarcely be more studiously
      refined in the taste and style of the vestments wherewith he adorneth his
      person.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not a whit so,&rsquo; laughed Firebras; &lsquo;the only difference between them is,
      that Beau Cripps wears in May the coat which Beau Villiers has worn in
      April.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mehercle!&rsquo; exclaimed Sir Norfolk. &lsquo;Such prodigality almost exceedeth
      belief.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Landlord, it is time!&rsquo; cried Father Verselyn, who performed the part of
      chairman, and occupied the principal seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am ready, your reverence,&rsquo; replied the landlord. And he forthwith
      proceeded to a cupboard, from which he produced a large china bowl,
      apparently filled with punch, and placed it with great care and solemnity
      in the centre of the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it is water,&rsquo; exclaimed Randulph, gazing at the clear lymph, with
      which, on nearer inspection, he perceived the bowl was filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To be sure!&rsquo; cried Firebras; &lsquo;and we are about to drink the king&rsquo;s health&mdash;<i>over
      the water</i>. And now, gentlemen,&rsquo; he continued, filling Randulph&rsquo;s glass
      and his own, &lsquo;fill, I pray you, to the brim.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have filled, even to the summit of the vase,&rsquo; said Sir Norfolk, rising
      and holding up his glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; cried Sir Bulkeley, likewise rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I,&rsquo; added the landlord, who stood next to the last-named baronet, and
      was allowed to join in the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I&mdash;and I,&rsquo; chimed Mr. Travers and the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then give the word, my son,&rsquo; said Verselyn, addressing Firebras.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;With the greatest pleasure, father,&rsquo; replied Cardwell. And he held his
      glass over the bowl, while his example was imitated by all the others
      except Randulph. &lsquo;Here is the king&rsquo;s health &ldquo;over the water.&rdquo; Why don&rsquo;t
      you do as we do?&rsquo; he added, turning to Randulph.

      Norfolk, pointing to the bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You <i>must</i> drink the toast&mdash;it&rsquo;s the rule of the club,&rsquo; added
      Sir Bulkeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a rule I cannot subscribe to,&rsquo; replied Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How!&mdash;am I mistaken in you, young man?&rsquo; said Firebras, regarding him
      menacingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Do as they bid you, or you&rsquo;ll have your throat cut, &lsquo;pon rep!&rsquo; whispered
      Mr. Cripps, popping his head over Firebras&rsquo;s shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you drink the toast, or not?&rsquo; demanded Firebras fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will not!&rsquo; replied Randulph firmly. &lsquo;It is treasonable, and I refuse
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Randulph&rsquo;s bold declaration had well-nigh cost him dear. Cries of &lsquo;spy!&rsquo; 
      &lsquo;traitor!&rsquo; &lsquo;Hanoverian!&rsquo; &lsquo;down with him!&rsquo; resounded on all sides; the
      landlord rushed to the door, and placed his back against it, to prevent
      any attempt at egress in that way; while Sir Norfolk Salusbury, plucking
      his long blade from its sheath, and making it whistle over his head,
      kicked a chair that stood between him and the young man out of the way,
      and bade him, in a stern tone, defend himself. The confusion was increased
      by the vociferations of Mr. Cripps, and by an accident caused by Sir
      Bulkeley Price, who, in hurrying round the table, contrived to entangle
      himself in the cover, and dragging it off, precipitated the bottles and
      glasses to the ground, drenching the lower limbs of his brother baronet in
      the contents of the fractured bowl. The only two persons apparently
      unmoved in the midst of this uproar were its author and Cardwell Firebras.
      The latter made no hostile display, and did not even alter his position,
      but kept his eye steadily fixed upon Randulph, as if anxious to observe
      the effect of the incident upon him. The young man maintained his firmness
      throughout. He retreated a few steps towards the wall, and put himself in
      a posture of defence. The nearest of his antagonists was Sir Norfolk
      Salusbury; but seeing the others press forward, the chivalrous Welsh
      baronet declined commencing the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Singulatim!&mdash;one at a time, Mr. Travers,&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Ne Hercules
      contra duos. It shall never be said that any man, however unworthy of fair
      treatment, fought against odds in the presence of a descendant of Adam de
      Salzburg. Stand aside, therefore, sir&mdash;and you, Father Verselyn&mdash;and
      leave him to me, or I must relinquish the right of combat, which I have in
      some measure acquired, as being the first to claim it, to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let the young man swear to keep silence touching all he has seen and
      heard, or he shall not quit this room alive,&rsquo; rejoined Travers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Trust him not&mdash;trust him not!&rsquo; cried Father Verselyn: &lsquo;his oath will
      not bind him. Fall upon him altogether and slay him! That is the only way
      to ensure his silence and our safety. I will absolve you of his blood. The
      imminence of the danger justifies the deed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Proh pudor!&rsquo; cried Sir Norfolk sternly. &lsquo;That would be trucidation
      dedecorous and ignave; neither can I stand by and see it done.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nor I,&rsquo; cried Sir Bulkeley, who had by this time recovered from the
      embarrassment occasioned by the accident. &lsquo;I disapprove of Father
      Verselyn&rsquo;s counsel entirely. Let us hear what the young man has to say. I
      will question him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haudquàquam, Sir Bulkeley,&rsquo; replied the other gravely, &lsquo;I gave you
      precedence on a recent occasion, but I cannot do so on the present. I
      claim this young man as my own&mdash;to interrogate, to fight, and,
      perchance, to slay him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fight him as much as you please, Sir Norfolk, and slay him if you think
      proper&mdash;or can,&rsquo; rejoined Sir Bulkeley angrily; &lsquo;but you shall not
      prevent my speaking to him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir Bulkeley Price,&rsquo; returned Sir Norfolk, raising his crane neck to its
      utmost height, &lsquo;I pray you not to interfere between me and Mr. Crew,
      otherwise&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, Sir Norfolk, and what then?&rsquo; cried the other, his hot Welsh blood
      mounting to his cheeks, and empurpling them more deeply than usual. &lsquo;What
      then, Sir Norfolk?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be compelled to make you render me reason for it,&rsquo; replied the
      other sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardwell Firebras now thought it time to interfere. &lsquo;Gentlemen,&rsquo; he said,
      advancing towards them, &lsquo;we have plenty of other quarrels to settle
      without disputing among ourselves. I brought Mr. Randulph Crew here, and
      will be responsible for his silence.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What saith the young man?&rsquo; demanded Sir Norfolk. &lsquo;If he will oppignerate
      his word for taciturnity, I will take it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So will I,&rsquo; added Sir Bulkeley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you for your good opinion of me, gentlemen,&rsquo; returned Randulph.
      &lsquo;I have been, almost unwittingly, a party to your counsels, and ought
      perhaps to have declared my sentiments sooner; but I hoped the meeting
      would pass off without rendering any such avowal necessary, in which case,
      though I certainly should never have joined your club again, the secret of
      its existence would have rested in my own bosom&mdash;as it will now, if I
      am suffered to depart. I could not avoid expressing my disapproval of a
      toast which, in common with every loyal subject of King George the Second,
      I hold to be treasonable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You cannot be the subject of a usurper, young man,&rsquo; said Firebras. &lsquo;Your
      allegiance to King James the Third is unalienable.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Compel him to avow allegiance to his rightful sovereign, Mr. Firebras,&rsquo; 
      interposed Father Verselyn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will sooner lay down my life than comply,&rsquo; cried Randulph resolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firebras looked slightly disconcerted; and Sir Norfolk, who had lowered
      the point of his sword, again raised it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is vain to reason with him, my son,&rsquo; whispered Verselyn. &lsquo;Our safety
      demands his destruction. If he goes hence we are denounced; and an
      irreparable injury will be done to the good cause.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have promised him safe conduct, father,&rsquo; rejoined Firebras; &lsquo;and, at
      all risks, I will keep my word. Mr. Randulph Crew, you are at liberty to
      depart. You give up all hopes of the miser&rsquo;s daughter?&rsquo; he added, in a
      deep whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must, if she is only to be purchased in this way,&rsquo; replied Randulph, in
      the same tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take time to consider of it,&rsquo; rejoined Firebras. &lsquo;I will find means of
      communicating with you to-morrow. Landlord, attend Mr. Crew to the door.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are wrong in letting him go,&rsquo; cried Verselyn. &lsquo;You will repent this
      blind confidence. Sir Norfolk, I entreat you to interfere&mdash;Sir
      Bulkeley, I appeal to you.&rsquo; But they both turned from him, and sheathed
      their swords; while the landlord, having received a sign from Firebras,
      obeyed his instructions.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Randulph was gone, Firebras addressed himself to the two
      baronets: &lsquo;I hope no unkindly feeling&mdash;none, at least, that cannot
      easily be set to rights&mdash;subsists between you, gentlemen?&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall never quarrel with my good friend, Sir Norfolk, except about a
      matter of punctilio,&rsquo; replied Sir Bulkeley, who was as easily appeased as
      roused to anger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I ought never to quarrel with one who knows how to make so handsome a
      concession as Sir Bulkeley Price,&rsquo; replied Sir Norfolk, with a gracious
      bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then the storm has blown over,&rsquo; laughed Firebras. &lsquo;I feared this more
      than the other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A long discussion then took place among the members of the club as to
      Randulph&rsquo;s introduction to it, and Firebras was severely censured by
      Father Verselyn for admitting the young man without testing his political
      principles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not repent what I have done, father,&rsquo; returned Firebras, &lsquo;because I
      am satisfied no harm will come of it; and it was an attempt to gain a very
      useful ally to our cause. He is a brave lad, as his firmness during this
      affair proved, and it would be a great point to win him over. Nor do I yet
      despair of doing so.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope we have seen the last of him,&rsquo; muttered Father Verselyn; &lsquo;and I
      beg it may be borne in mind that it was against my advice that he was
      suffered to depart.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardwell Firebras darted an angry look at the priest, but he made no
      reply; and the cloth having been replaced by the landlord and Mr. Cripps,
      the former proceeded to fetch a fresh supply of flasks and glasses; after
      which the company once more gathered round the table, and began to discuss
      anew their projects.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>idnight arrived,
      and found the party still in deep debate. Suddenly, a quick and continuous
      knocking was heard at the door. All instantly started to their feet,
      gazing at each other in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are betrayed,&rsquo; said Firebras, in a deep whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are,&rsquo; replied Father Verselyn; &lsquo;and by the spy you introduced among
      us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is false!&rsquo; cried Firebras angrily. &lsquo;But this is no time for dispute.
      We must provide for our safety. Who is it, landlord?&rsquo; he cried to the
      host, who, on the first alarm, had rushed to the door, and opened the
      reconnoitring hole within it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;O lud! we&rsquo;re all lost!&rsquo; rejoined the landlord, closing the trap-door, and
      returning to them with scared looks and on tiptoe, as if afraid&rsquo; of the
      sound of his own footsteps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is it?&mdash;what is it?&rsquo; demanded Firebras.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A dozen grenadier guards, headed by their captain and lieutenant, come to
      search the house,&rsquo; replied the landlord. &lsquo;They&rsquo;re mounting the stairs
      now.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Zounds!&rsquo; exclaimed Sir Bulkeley, &lsquo;this is awkward!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is nothing to fear,&rsquo; said Firebras calmly. &lsquo;We have plenty of time
      for flight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, you can fly, gentlemen, but I am ruined,&rsquo; exclaimed the landlord. &lsquo;I
      can never return to my own dwelling!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pshaw! you shall never be the worse for it,&rsquo; replied Firebras.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But what will become of me, if I am taken?&rsquo; cried Mr. Cripps, feigning a
      look of despair. &lsquo;I am sure to be the worse for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Silence!&rsquo; cried Firebras authoritatively. &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t you hear them?&mdash;they
      are at the door. Be quick, gentlemen. Not a moment is to be lost.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While this was passing, Father Verselyn hurried to the lower end of the
      room, and, mounting a ladder placed against the wall, passed through a
      trap-door in the ceiling above it. The landlord, Mr. Cripps, and Mr.
      Travers next ascended; then Sir Bulkeley followed; then Sir Norfolk, whose
      equanimity not even the present danger could disturb; while Firebras
      brought up the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Sdeath, Sir Norfolk!&rsquo; cried the latter, as the baronet slowly scaled the
      steps before him&mdash;&lsquo;move on a little more quickly, or we shall
      certainly be captured. They&rsquo;re breaking open the door. Don&rsquo;t you hear
      them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Perfecté,&rsquo; replied Sir Norfolk coolly. But he did not on that account
      accelerate his movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Knowing it was in vain to remonstrate, Cardwell Firebras waited till Sir
      Norfolk had worked his long frame through the trap-door, which he did with
      the utmost deliberation, and then ran up the steps himself, with much more
      activity than might have been expected from a person so weighty. Just as
      he was quitting the ladder, the door was burst open with a tremendous
      crash, and two officers of the guard rushed into the room, sword in hand,
      followed by a dozen grenadiers armed with muskets, on which bayonets were
      fixed. Firebras&rsquo;s first object, on securing a footing on the floor of the
      garret above, was to try to draw up the ladder, and he was assisted in the
      endeavour by Sir Norfolk; but their design was frustrated by the foremost
      officer and a tall grenadier bearing a halberd, both of whom sprang upon
      the ladder, and kept it down by their joint weight, and all that those
      above could do was to shut down the trap-door, before it could be reached
      by their foes. A dormer window opened from the garret upon the roof of the
      house; but an unexpected difficulty had been experienced by the first
      detachment of fugitives in unfastening it. All ought to have been in
      readiness for an emergency like the present, and Sir Bulkeley and Mr.
      Travers bitterly reproached the landlord for his negligence. The poor
      fellow declared that the mischance was not his fault&mdash;that he had
      taken every possible precaution&mdash;and, in fact, had examined the
      window that very morning, and found it all right.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0009" id="linkimage-0009"> </a>

      <a href="images/0320.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At length it was forced back, and all but Sir Norfolk and Firebras got
      through it. They were detained by the necessity that existed of guarding
      the trap-door. Unfortunately, there was no bolt on the upper side of it,
      so that they had to stand upon it to keep it down, and this plan being
      discovered by the officer below, he ordered two of his men to thrust their
      bayonets through the boards, while the tall grenadier tried to prize open
      the door with his halberd. The manoeuvre compelled Firebras and Salus-bury
      slightly to alter their position, to avoid being wounded by the bayonets,
      and in doing so, they necessarily gave admittance to the point of the
      halberd. The efforts of the assailing party were redoubled, and the trap
      slightly yielded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lose not a moment! fly, Sir Norfolk!&rsquo; cried Firebras, apprehensive lest
      the baronet&rsquo;s deliberation, which he well knew nothing could shake, should
      prevent his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      But true to his principles, Sir Norfolk would not move an inch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I cannot leave you in angusto,&rsquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But I am the stronger of the two, as well as the more active,&rsquo; rejoined
      Firebras. &lsquo;My weight will suffice to keep down the trap-door till you have
      got through the window, and then I can make good my retreat. Fly! fly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But Sir Norfolk continued immovable. &lsquo;I shall be the last to quit this
      place,&rsquo; he said, in a tone of unalterable determination. &lsquo;But do not, I
      pray you, tarry with me. The trifurciferous myrmidons of the Hanoverian
      usurper shall never take me with life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I must leave the punctilious old fool to his fate,&rsquo; muttered Firebras,
      observing that the greater part of the head of the halberd was forced
      through the side of the trap. &lsquo;God protect you, Sir Norfolk,&rsquo; he cried,
      rushing to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brave old Welsh baronet essayed to hew off the head of the halberd
      from the staff&mdash;but in vain; and finding that the enemy must gain
      admittance in another moment, and that Firebras had cleared the window, he
      turned away and strode majestically towards it. His retreat was so
      suddenly made, that the grenadier who held the pike, and was prizing with
      all his force, lost his balance, and tumbled off the ladder, causing such
      confusion among his comrades, that Sir Norfolk had time to get through the
      window unmolested.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a beautfully bright night&mdash;the moon being at the full, and the
      sky filled with fleecy clouds. On the left lay ridges of pointed-roofed
      houses, covered with the warm-looking and mellow-tinted tile, so
      preferable to the cold blue slate&mdash;broken with stacks of chimneys of
      every size and form&mdash;dormer windows, gables, overhanging storeys and
      other picturesque and fantastic projections; and the view being
      terminated, at some quarter of a mile&rsquo;s distance, by the tall towers and
      part of the roof of Westminster Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Viewed thus, the whole picture looked exquisitely tranquil and beautiful.
      The fires in the houses were almost all extinguished, and little or no
      smoke issued from the chimneys to pollute the clear atmosphere. Above the
      venerable and majestic fane hung the queen of night, flooding its towers&mdash;seen
      at such an hour to the greatest advantage&mdash;with silvery light, and
      throwing some of the nearer buildings and projections into deep shadow,
      and so adding to the beauty of the scene. On the right, the view extended
      over other house-tops to the gardens and fields of Pimlico. Behind was
      Saint James&rsquo;s Park, with its stately avenues of trees, its long canal, and
      Rosamond&rsquo;s Pond glimmering in the moonlight; while in front lay the New
      Artillery Ground, and the open and marshy grounds constituting Totnill
      Fields. But it will be readily imagined that neither Firebras nor his
      companions looked to the right or to the left. They were only conscious of
      the danger by which they were menaced, and were further discouraged by
      Father Verselyn, who at that moment scrambled over the roof they were
      about to cross, to inform them that the door by which they hoped to escape
      could not be got open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Everything seems to have gone wrong! cried Verselyn in an ecstasy of
      terror. &lsquo;What will become of us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jacta est alea,&rsquo; replied Sir Norfolk composedly. &lsquo;We must fight for it,
      father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Heaven and all its saints protect us,&rsquo; cried the priest, crossing
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be composed, father,&rsquo; rejoined Firebras sternly. &lsquo;You ought to be equal
      to any circumstances in which you may be placed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter exclamation was occasioned by a joyous shout, announcing that
      their friends had succeeded in opening the door; and the next moment the
      good news was confirmed by Sir Bulkeley Price, who clambered over the roof
      to acquaint them with it. On hearing this the party instantly beat a
      retreat; and their flight was accelerated by the officer and the tall
      grenadier, who at that moment sprung out of the window. Even Sir Norfolk
      was urged to a little more expedition than usual; and two or three of his
      mighty strides brought him to the top of the roof. Cardwell Firebras would
      not have been much behind him, if Father Verselyn had not caught hold of
      his coat-tails to help himself up the ascent, which he felt wholly unable
      to accomplish without assistance. By this time the officer was well-nigh
      upon them; and, finding his summons to surrender wholly disregarded, he
      made a pass at the priest, which took effect in the fleshy part of his
      leg, restoring him at once to more than his former agility. Uttering a
      loud yell, and clapping his hand to the wounded limb to stanch the blood,
      Father Verselyn bounded over the roof, and made to the door through which
      the landlord and Mr. Travers had already disappeared, and through which
      Mr. Cripps was now darting. Between the two roofs lay a small flat space,
      used by its former proprietor as a place for drying clothes, as was
      evident from the four tall posts at the corners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Firebras and Sir Norfolk came to a stand, resolved to dispute the
      passage with their pursuers. Sword in hand, and calling to them to
      surrender, the foremost officer dashed down the roof; but his
      precipitation placed him at the mercy of Fire-bras; for his foot slipping,
      the latter struck his sword from his grasp. Sir Norfolk, in the interim,
      had encountered another foeman with equal success. This was the tall
      grenadier, who, as he descended, made a thrust at the baronet with his
      halberd, which the latter very adroitly parried, and, lunging in return,
      disabled his adversary by a wound in the arm. At the same moment, too, the
      tiles gave way under the weight of the grenadier, and he sank above the
      knees in the roof. Other foes were now at hand. The second officer,
      carrying a lantern in one hand, and a drawn sword in the other, appeared
      on the roof; while the tall caps and bayonets of the rest of the
      grenadiers were seen above it. Though Sir Norfolk, whose blood was up,
      would have willingly awaited the advance of these new opponents, he
      yielded to the entreaties of Firebras, and followed him through the door,
      which was instantly secured behind them by a couple of strong bolts.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house in which the Jacobites had taken refuge was expressly hired by
      them for an occasion like the present, and kept wholly uninhabited. The
      mode of communication between it and the Rose and Crown will, it is hoped,
      be sufficiently understood from the foregoing description. That so many
      unforeseen accidents should have occurred at a time when, if ever, things
      ought to have been in readiness, almost drove the poor landlord
      distracted; but if he could have watched Mr. Cripps&rsquo;s manoeuvres, he would
      have speedily found out the cause of the delays. In the first instance, a
      penknife, dexterously slipped by the valet into the groove of the window,
      prevented it from moving, and had well-nigh, as has been seen, occasioned
      the capture of the fugitives. This difficulty having been overcome by the
      strenuous efforts of Sir Bulkeley and Mr. Travers, Mr. Cripps was the
      first to scramble through the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Which way?&rsquo; he cried to the landlord, who was following.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Over the roof, and to the door opposite,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nimbly as a cat the agile valet bounded over the roof, and instantly
      perceiving the door, made towards it. A key was in the lock; he turned it,
      took it out, and dropped it into the street below. He then began to shake
      the door violently, and shouted to the landlord, who at that moment came
      in sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Unlock it&mdash;unlock it!&rsquo; cried the host.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; cried Mr. Cripps; &lsquo;there is no key. &lsquo;Pon rep! we shall be all
      taken.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No key!&rsquo; exclaimed the landlord. &lsquo;Impossible! I saw it there this morning
      myself. It must have dropped down. Look about for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cripps feigned compliance, and the landlord coming up, poured forth a
      torrent of imprecations on finding his statement correct. Father Verselyn,
      as has been related, crept back to Firebras, while the others used their
      efforts to open the door. Nor were they long in effecting their purpose.
      Finding all other attempts fail, the landlord stepped back on the leads,
      and running to give additional impetus to the blow, dashed his foot
      against the door, and the lock yielded with a loud crash.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>arylebone Gardens,
      it is well known, lay on the eastern side of the upper end of the lane
      bearing the same name&mdash;the whole of the country beyond Harley Street,
      which was not more than a third of its present extent, being open fields.
      They were of considerable size, and were originally laid out and planted
      at the beginning of the last century, at which time the public were
      gratuitously admitted to them. In one part of the grounds there was an
      excellent bowling-green, which drew many lovers of that most agreeable
      recreation to it. By degrees the gardens, being very conveniently
      situated, rose in repute; and in 1737, their proprietor, Mr. Gough, began
      to demand a shilling for admittance&mdash;this sum entitling the visitor
      to its value in refreshments. But still further improvements were
      effected. Orchestras, boxes, and a theatre for musical entertainments were
      erected within them. Besides the main walks, semicircular rows of trees
      were planted, and hedges contrived so as to form pleasing labyrinths for
      those who preferred privacy. Bowers and alcoves were built in different
      places; lamps were fastened to the trees, and at night, on the occasion of
      a fête, every part of the garden was illuminated with myriads of lamps of
      various colours. The company began to improve, and the price of admission
      was raised to five shillings. Fêtes of every kind were held here; and the
      place continued in vogue until nearly the end of the century with which
      its rise commenced. Malcolm mentions that a few trees, once forming part
      of Marylebone Gardens, were standing at the north end of Harley Street in
      1808. But we fear not even a stump of one of them is now left. Carriages,
      coaches, and chairs were setting down their occupants at the entrance to
      the gardens as Mr. Cripps and his companion drew near. Never had Mrs.
      Nettle-ship seen a gayer throng&mdash;the dresses she thought magnificent.
      There was Lady Ancaster, whom Mr. Cripps pointed out to her, in a brocaded
      lutestring sack, with ruby-coloured ground and white tobine stripes
      trimmed with floss&mdash;the Countess of Pomfret, in a black satin sack
      flowered with red and white&mdash;Lady Almeria Vane, in a scarlet
      unwatered tabby sack&mdash;Lady Ilchester, in a white tissue flowered
      sack. All these ladies wore hoops; but none of them, Mr. Cripps assured
      his companion, managed this equipment with half so much grace as herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout this stage of the business, Mr. Cripps had some difficulty in
      playing his part, and it required all his effrontery to enable him to go
      through with it. Having affirmed to his companion that he was an intimate
      acquaintance of all the ladies of rank he encountered, and in the habit of
      attending their routs and parties, he was under the necessity of
      sustaining the character, and kept constantly bowing and kissing his hand
      to them. In most cases he succeeded; for the ladies he addressed, deceived
      by his showy attire, which seemed to mark him as somebody, returned his
      salutations. Mrs. Nettleship was enchanted. To be attended by so
      fashionable a person, who knew all the <i>beau monde</i>, was supreme
      felicity. She would have given the world to be introduced to some of the
      fashionable ladies, and intimated as much to her companion; but he was too
      shrewd to attend to the suggestion, contenting himself with saying, with a
      very impassioned look, &lsquo;I hope, my angel, that one of these days I shall
      have the honour of introducing you to my fair friends under another
      name.&lsquo;Twould make me the happiest of men&mdash;&lsquo;pon rep!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Odd&rsquo;s bodikins! Mr. Willars, how you do confuse me!&rsquo; exclaimed the lady,
      spreading her large fan before her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time they had gained the principal avenue leading towards the
      orchestra, and at each step he took, Mr. Cripps kissed his hand to some
      elegantly dressed person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s my friend Lord Effingham, and his countess,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;glad to
      see you, my lord. That&rsquo;s the pretty Mrs. Rackham&mdash;a bride,
      sweetheart, <i>a bride</i>,&rsquo; with tender emphasis&mdash;&lsquo;that&rsquo;s the rich
      Mrs. Draper&mdash;I daren&rsquo;t look at her, for she&rsquo;s determined to have me,
      whether I will or no, and I can&rsquo;t make up my mind to it, though she&rsquo;s
      promised to settle sixty thousand pounds upon me, and to die in six
      months.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;La! Mr. Willars, you wouldn&rsquo;t sell yourself to such an ojus creature as
      that!&rsquo; cried Mrs. Nettleship&mdash;&lsquo;why, she&rsquo;s a perfect fright, and so
      dressed!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Precisely what you describe her, &lsquo;pon rep!&rsquo; replied Mr. Cripps. &lsquo;But do
      listen to the music. Isn&rsquo;t it inspiring?&rsquo; And they paused for a moment to
      listen to the lively strains proceeding from the orchestra, which was
      placed at one end of a large building facing the principal walk. By this
      time the company had almost entirely assembled. The main walk was
      completely thronged, and presented the appearance of the Mall at high
      tide, while all the boxes and alcoves were filled with persons discussing
      bowls of punch, plates of ham, chickens, salads, and other good things.
      The band in the orchestra was excellent, and the lively airs and
      symphonies added to the excitement and spirit of the scene. Mr. Cripps
      created a great sensation. Many persons thought they had seen him before,
      but no one could tell who he was. Meanwhile, the object of this attention
      continued to dispense his bows and smiles, flourished his clouded cane,
      tapped his magnificent snuff-box, and after astonishing all the beholders
      with his coxcombry, glided off with his companion into one of the side
      walks. He had scarcely disappeared, when Lady Brabazon and her party
      entered the main walk. Her ladyship led her little spaniel by its string,
      and was attended on one side by the beau, and on the other by Trussell.
      Behind them walked Clementina, who had contrived to allure Randulph from
      her mother, and to attach him to her, while on the young man&rsquo;s left walked
      Sir Singleton Spinke. Everybody whom Mr. Villiers encountered told him of
      the prodigious beau who had just been seen on the walk&mdash;Lord
      Effingham, Major Burrowes, Lord Dyneover, Sir John Fagg&mdash;all
      described him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who the devil is he?&rsquo; cried Villiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Haven&rsquo;t the least idea,&rsquo; replied Sir John Fagg. &lsquo;But I&rsquo;ll speak to him,
      if I meet him again. He&rsquo;s your very double, Villiers. I&rsquo;ll swear he has
      employed Desmartins to make him a suit precisely like your own.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Has he?&rsquo; cried the beau indignantly&mdash;&lsquo;Then I&rsquo;ll never employ a
      rascally Frenchman again! and what is more, I won&rsquo;t pay him his bill.&rsquo; The
      same thing was told him by twenty other persons, and the beau looked
      anxiously round for his personator, but was for some time unable to
      discern him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Mr. Cripps had sought this secluded walk to give him an
      opportunity of making a declaration to the widow, and though he was not
      positively accepted he was not decidedly refused,&mdash;the lady only
      asking time to consider over the proposal. The audacious valet was on his
      knees, and rapturously kissing her hand, vowing he would never rise till
      he received a favourable answer to his suit, when two persons were seen
      approaching, whom, to his infinite mortification and surprise, he
      recognised as Abel Beechcroft and his uncle, Mr. Jukes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We are interrupted, my charmer!&rsquo; he cried, getting up, with a countenance
      of angry dismay. &lsquo;Let us return to the public promenade. You won&rsquo;t refuse
      me? I shall kill myself, &lsquo;pon rep, if you do.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll think of it, Mr. Willars,&rsquo; said Mrs. Nettleship, twirling her fan.
      &lsquo;But it would be a dreadful thing if I was to break my engagement to Mr.
      Rathbone!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! curse Mr. Rathbone! I&rsquo;ll cut his throat!&rsquo; cried Mr. Cripps, glancing
      anxiously down the walk. But unfortunately there was no outlet at the
      lower end, and he was compelled to turn and face the intruders. He looked
      also to the right and left, but on neither side was there an alcove into
      which he could retreat. Nothing was left for it but impudence, and luckily
      for him, this quality seldom deserted him at a pinch. Putting on his
      boldest manner, he strutted gaily, and with affected nonchalance, towards
      Abel and his uncle, who, as he advanced, stepped a little aside to look at
      him.
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0330.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, as I live!&rsquo; cried Abel, &lsquo;that&rsquo;s Mr. Villiers&rsquo;s valet&mdash;your
      nephew, Jukes.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lord save us! so it is,&rsquo; cried Mr. Jukes, lifting up his hands in
      astonishment. &lsquo;Why, Crackenthorpe, what are you doing here&mdash;and in
      your master&rsquo;s clothes?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Truce to your jests, old fellow,&rsquo; said Mr. Cripps, waving him off, &lsquo;and
      let me pass.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What! disown your uncle!&rsquo; cried Mr. Jukes angrily, &lsquo;and in the presence
      of his worthy master! The rascal would deny his own father. Pay me the ten
      crowns you borrowed yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;La! Mr. Willars, what&rsquo;s the meaning of all this?&rsquo; asked Mrs. Nettleship.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pon my soul, my angel, I don&rsquo;t know, unless the old hunks has been
      drinking,&rsquo; replied Mr. Cripps. &lsquo;The &lsquo;rack punch has evidently got into his
      head, and made him mistake one person for another.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&rsquo;Rack punch!&rsquo; cried Mr. Jukes furiously. &lsquo;I haven&rsquo;t tasted a drop! You
      call him Mr. Willars, ma&rsquo;am,&rsquo; he added to Mrs. Nettleship. &lsquo;He&rsquo;s deceiving
      you, ma&rsquo;am. He&rsquo;s not Mr. Willars&mdash;he&rsquo;s Mr. Willars&rsquo;s gentleman&mdash;his
      valet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A truce to this folly, you superannuated old dolt!&rsquo; cried Mr. Cripps,
      raising his cane, &lsquo;or I&rsquo;ll chastise you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Chastise me!&rsquo; exclaimed the butler angrily. &lsquo;Touch me, if you dare,
      rascal; Crackenthorpe, Crackenthorpe&mdash;you&rsquo;ll certainly be hanged.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let him alone, Jukes,&rsquo; interposed Abel. &lsquo;He&rsquo;ll meet his master at the
      corner of the walk, and I should like to see how he&rsquo;ll carry it off.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking advantage of the interference, Mr. Cripps passed on with his
      inamorata, who was as anxious to escape from the scene as himself; while
      Abel and Mr. Jukes followed them at a short distance. It fell out as Abel
      had foreseen. As Mr. Cripps issued into the broad walk, right before him,
      and not many yards off, were his master and Lady Brabazon, together with
      the rest of the party. If the valet ever had need of assurance, it was
      now. But though ready to sink into the earth, he was true to himself, and
      exhibited no outward signs of discomposure. On the contrary, he drew forth
      his snuff-box, took a pinch in his airiest manner, and said to Mrs.
      Nettleship&mdash;&lsquo;There&rsquo;s Lady Brabazon&mdash;accounted one of the finest
      women of the day, but upon my soul, she&rsquo;s not to be compared with you.&rsquo; 
      With this he made a profound salutation to Lady Brabazon, who looked
      petrified with astonishment, and kissed his hand to Trussell, who was
      ready to die with laughing. As to the beau, he grasped his cane in a
      manner that plainly betokened his intention of laying it across his
      valet&rsquo;s shoulders. But the latter, divining his intention, and seeing that
      nothing but a bold manoeuvre could now save him, strutted up to him, and
      said in a loud voice&mdash;&lsquo;Ah! my dear fellow&mdash;how d&rsquo;ye do?&mdash;glad
      to see you&mdash;plenty of company&rsquo;&mdash;adding, in a lower tone&mdash;&lsquo;for
      Heaven&rsquo;s sake, sir, don&rsquo;t mar my fortune. I&rsquo;m about to be married to that
      lady, sir&mdash;large fortune, sir&mdash;to-day will decide it&mdash;&lsquo;pon
      rep!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Villiers regarded him in astonishment, mixed with some little
      admiration; and at length his good-nature got the better of his anger.
      &lsquo;Well, get you gone instantly,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;if I find you in the gardens in
      ten minutes from this time, you shall have the caning you merit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Good day, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Cripps&mdash;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not forget the favour.&rsquo; 
      And with a profound bow, he moved away with the widow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And so you have let him off?&rsquo; cried Lady Brabazon, in amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Upon my soul, I couldn&rsquo;t help it,&rsquo; replied the beau. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve a
      fellow-feeling for the rascal&mdash;and, egad, all things considered, he
      has played his part so uncommonly well, that I hope he may be successful.&rsquo;

      <span class="head">DAY MASQUERADE IN RANELAGH GARDENS</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>nd now, before
      entering Ranelagh, it may be proper to offer a word as to its history.
      Alas for the changes and caprices of fashion! This charming place of
      entertainment, the delight of our grandfathers and grandmothers, the boast
      of the metropolis, the envy of foreigners, the renowned in song and story,
      the paradise of hoops and wigs, is vanished,&mdash;numbered with the
      things that were!&mdash;and we fear there is little hope of its revival.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranelagh, it is well known, derived its designation from a nobleman of the
      same name, by whom the house was erected, and the gardens, esteemed the
      most beautiful in the kingdom, originally laid out. Its situation adjoined
      the Royal Hospital at Chelsea, and the date of its erection was 1690-1.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ranelagh House, on the death of the earl in 1712, passed into the
      possession of his daughter, Lady Catherine Jones; but was let, about
      twenty years afterwards, to two eminent builders, who relet it to Lacy,
      afterwards patentee of Drury Lane Theatre, and commonly called Gentleman
      Lacy, by whom it was taken with the intention of giving concerts and
      breakfasts within it, on a scale far superior, in point of splendour and
      attraction, to any that had been hitherto attempted.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 1741 the premises were sold by Lacy to Messrs. Crispe and Meyonnet for
      £4000, and the rotunda was erected in the same year by subscription. From
      this date the true history of Ranelagh may be said to commence. It at once
      burst into fashion, and its entertainments being attended by persons of
      the first quality, crowds flocked in their train, shortly after its
      opening, Mr. Crispe became the sole lessee; and in spite of the brilliant
      success of the enterprise, shared the fate of most lessees of places of
      public amusement, being declared bankrupt in 1744. The property was then
      divided into thirty shares, and so continued until Ranelagh was closed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earliest entertainments of Ranelagh were morning concerts, consisting
      chiefly of oratorios, produced under the direction of Michael Festing, the
      leader of the band; but evening concerts were speedily introduced, the
      latter, it may be mentioned, to show the difference of former fashionable
      hours from the present, commencing at half-past five, and concluding at
      nine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus it began, but towards its close, the gayest visitors to Ranelagh went
      at midnight, just as the concerts were finishing, and remained there till
      three or four in the morning. In 1754 the fashionable world were drawn to
      Ranelagh by a series of amusements called Comus&rsquo;s Court; and
      notwithstanding their somewhat questionable title, the revels were
      conducted with great propriety and decorum. A procession which was
      introduced was managed with great effect, and several mock Italian duets
      were sung with remarkable spirit. Almost to its close, Ranelagh retained
      its character of being the finest place of public entertainment in Europe,
      and to the last the rotunda was the wonder and delight of every beholder.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coup-d&rsquo;oeil of the interior of this structure was extraordinarily
      striking, and impressed all who beheld it for the first time with
      surprise. It was circular in form, and exactly one hundred and fifty feet
      in diameter. Round the lower part of the building ran a beautiful arcade,
      the intervals between each arch being filled up by alcoves. Over this was
      a gallery with a balustrade, having entrances from the exterior, and
      forming a sort of upper boxes. Above the gallery was a range of
      round-headed windows, between each of which was a carved figure supporting
      the roof, and forming the terminus of the column beneath. At first, the
      orchestra was placed in the centre of the amphitheatre, but being found
      exceedingly inconvenient, as well as destructive of the symmetry of the
      building in that situation, it was removed to the side.
    </p>
    <p>
      It contained a stage capable of accommodating thirty or forty chorus
      singers. The original site of the orchestra was occupied by a large
      chimney, having four faces enclosed in a beautifully proportioned, hollow,
      hexagonal column, with arched openings at the sides, and a balustrade at
      the base. Richly moulded, and otherwise ornamented with appropriate
      designs, this enormous column had a charming effect, and gave a peculiar
      character to the whole amphitheatre. A double range of large chandeliers
      descended from the ceiling; others were placed within the column above
      mentioned, and every alcove had its lamp. When all these chandeliers and
      lamps were lighted, the effect was wonderfully brilliant.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0011" id="linkimage-0011"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0340.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The external diameter of the rotunda was one hundred and eighty-five feet.
      It was surrounded on the outside by an arcade similar to that within,
      above which ran a gallery with a roof supported by pillars, and defended
      by a balustrade. The main entrance was a handsome piece of architecture,
      with a wide, round, arched gate in the centre, and a lesser entrance at
      either side.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the left of the rotunda stood the Earl of Ranelagh&rsquo;s old mansion, a
      structure of some magnitude, but with little pretensions to beauty, being
      built in the formal Dutch taste of the time of William of Orange. On the
      right, opposite the mansion, was a magnificent conservatory, with great
      pots of aloes in front. In a line with the conservatory, and the side
      entrance of the rotunda, stretched out a long and beautiful canal, in the
      midst of which stood a Chinese fishing temple, approached by a bridge. On
      either side of the canal were broad gravel walks, and alleys shaded by
      lines of trees, and separated by trimly clipped hedges. The gardens were
      exquisitely arranged with groves, bowers, statues, temples, wildernesses,
      and shady retreats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though Lady Brabazon&rsquo;s carriage was within a hundred yards of the entrance
      of Ranelagh when Mr. Cripps and his party passed it, owing to the crowd
      and confusion it was nearly a quarter of an hour in setting down. Before
      getting out, the whole party put on their masks; and Lady Brabazon wrapped
      herself in a yellow silk domino. Trussell took charge of Clementina, and
      her ladyship fell to Randulph&rsquo;s care.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was yet extremely early, but the crowd was prodigious,&mdash;many
      hundred persons being assembled in the area before the entrance to the
      rotunda. At least a thousand others were dispersed within the gardens, for
      the rotunda was not opened till the evening; and it was afterwards
      computed that more than four thousand persons attended the masquerade.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the entrance, Lady Brabazon and her daughter were joined by Beau
      Villiers, Sir Bulkeley Price, and Firebras, Sir Singleton Spinke having
      disappeared. Randulph had already been more than once at Ranelagh, but it
      was only to attend the ordinary concerts, and never having seen a
      masquerade, he was extraordinarily struck with the spectacle presented to
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most of the characters were grotesquely dressed, as was the taste of the
      time, for it was not a period when the niceties of costume were understood
      or regarded; still, the general effect was admirable. A May-pole,
      surmounted by a crown, with long ribands dangling from it, was planted in
      front of the conservatory, and several dancers were chasing each other
      round it, while lively strains were played by a band of musicians beside
      them. Other and less melodious sounds were heard. Now a drummer would go
      by, beating a rub-a-dub enough to deafen every listener. Then came the
      vile scraping of a fiddle, or the shrill notes of a fife. The shouts, the
      laughter, the cries of all kinds baffled description, and equally vain
      would it be to attempt any delineation of the motley assemblage. It
      consisted of persons of all countries, all periods, and all ranks, for the
      most part oddly enough jumbled together. A pope in his tiara would be
      conversing with a Jew; a grave lawyer in his gown and wig had a milk-girl
      under his arm; a highland chief in his full equipments escorted a nun; a
      doge in his splendid habiliments was jesting with a common sailor, with a
      thick stick under his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      But frolic and fun everywhere prevailed; and to judge from the noise,
      everybody seemed to be merry. No one could escape from the tricks and
      jests of the buffoons with whom the crowd abounded. The humour of the last
      century was eminently practical; cuffs and kicks were liberally dealt
      around, and returned in kind; and whenever a sounding blow was heard, it
      elicited shouts of laughter like those that are heard at the feigned
      knocks in a pantomime. The clowns, punches, pierrots, doctors, and
      harlequins, of whom there were several besides our friend, Mr. Cripps,
      were the chief creators of this kind of merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Randulph, greatly diverted by all he saw, was gazing around, a few
      words pronounced by a voice whose tones thrilled to his heart caught his
      ear. He turned, and saw close behind him, attended by a tall personage,
      whose stiffness left no doubt as to its being Sir Norfolk Salusbury, a
      beautiful female mask, whose snowy skin and dark streaming ringlets would
      have told him, if his heart had not informed him of the fact, that it was
      Hilda, but before he could summon resolution to address her, she had
      passed by; and Lady Brabazon, who had likewise heard the voice and
      recognised the speaker, dragged him in the opposite direction towards the
      May-pole. He looked eagerly backwards, but the fair mask was lost amid the
      throng, nor could he even discern the tall figure of Sir Norfolk.

      <span class="head">RANDULPH AND HILDA DANCING IN THE ROTUNDA AT RANELAGH
      GARDENS</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>ome hours passed
      on in this way, and Randulph was still held in bondage. At length the
      rotunda was opened. Of course, the royal party was ceremoniously ushered
      in, in the first place; but immediately afterwards crowds poured-in, and
      the whole area of the amphitheatre, together with the boxes and gallery
      above, were filled with company. What with the innumerable lights, and the
      extraordinary variety of dresses, the whole scene had a most brilliant
      effect. There was an excellent band in the orchestra, and a concert was
      commenced, but little attention was paid to it by the assemblage, who
      continued promenading round and round the amphitheatre&mdash;laughing and
      talking loudly with each other.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the concert was over, the loud blowing of a horn attracted
      general observation to a platform near the central column, on which the
      quack doctor and his attendant were stationed&mdash;the latter of whom
      began dispensing his medicines, and vaunting their efficacy, in a highly
      ludicrous manner. This and other entertainments consumed the time till ten
      o&rsquo;clock; before which, however, a magnificent supper was served to the
      royal party in a private refreshment room.
    </p>
    <p>
      A bell was then rung, to announce that a grand display of fireworks was
      about to take place, and the company hurried to the outer galleries and to
      the gardens to witness the exhibition. Much confusion ensued, and amidst
      it, the fair Thomasine, somehow or other, got separated from her party.
      The little barber was almost frantic. He rushed hither and thither among
      the crowd, calling for her by name, and exciting general ridicule. At
      last, in an agony of despair, he stationed himself near the scaffold where
      the fireworks were placed; and when the first signal-rocket ascended, he
      perceived her pretty face turned upwards at a little distance from him.
      She was standing near the trees with the old beau, whose transports at his
      enviable situation were somewhat disturbed by the descent of a heavy
      rocket-stick on his head. At this juncture the little barber reached his
      truant mistress, and forcing her from Sir Singleton, placed her rounded
      arm under his own, and held it fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, dear, how glad I am to see you,&rsquo; said the naughty little Thomasine,
      for &lsquo;fair&rsquo; she does not deserve to be called; &lsquo;we&rsquo;ve been looking for you
      everywhere&rsquo;&mdash;(here she told a sad story). &lsquo;That odious old beau has
      been trying to persuade me to run away with him. He offers to settle&mdash;I
      don&rsquo;t know what&mdash;upon me, and to make me Lady Spinke.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And why don&rsquo;t you accept his offer?&rsquo; said the barber, in an ecstasy of
      jealous rage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I&rsquo;m engaged, and engagements with me are sacred things,&rsquo; replied
      the fair Thomasine theatrically, yet tenderly. &lsquo;But do look at that
      beautiful wheel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The fireworks were really splendid. Flights of rockets soared into the
      skies; magnificent wheels performed their mutations; star-pieces poured
      forth their radiant glories; maroon batteries resounded; Chinese fountains
      filled the air with glittering showers; pots-des-aigrettes,
      pots-des-brins, and pots-des-saucis-sons discharged their stars, serpents,
      and crackers; yew-trees burnt with brilliant fire; water-rockets turned
      the canal to flame; fire-balloons ascended; and a grand car with flaming
      wheels, drawn by sea-horses snorting fire, and containing a figure of
      Neptune, which, traversed the whole length of the canal, and encircled the
      Chinese temple&mdash;the bridge being removed to make way for it&mdash;and
      finally exploded, scattering serpents and crackers in every direction,
      concluded the exhibition, amid the general plaudits of the assemblage.
      Darkness for a few minutes enveloped the crowd, during which a few cries
      were heard in timid female tones; but the lamps were as soon as possible
      lighted, and the majority of the assemblage returned to the rotunda, where
      they repaired to the alcoves, and many a bowl of punch was emptied, many a
      bottle of champagne quaffed; after which dancing was resumed with greater
      spirit than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rathbone gave a capital supper to his party, in which the old beau
      contrived to get himself included. He contrived also to sit near the fair
      Thomasine, and pledged her so often and so deeply that he fell beneath the
      table. Here he was left by the others, and a minuet being struck up, Mr.
      Cripps offered his hand to the widow, and led her forth to dance; while
      Mr. Rathbone, greatly exhilarated by the punch he had drunk, stood by,
      laughing at them ready to split his sides; and the little barber took the
      opportunity of their being left alone together, to reprove the fair
      Thomasine for her improper conduct towards the old beau during supper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Liberated by the departure of the Prince of Wales, who quitted the gardens
      on the conclusion of the fireworks, Randulph immediately returned to the
      rotunda, in the hope of finding Hilda still there. He had scarcely entered
      it when he perceived Firebras at supper by himself in one of the alcoves,
      and instantly joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;She is still here,&rsquo; said Firebras, &lsquo;and as soon as I have finished my
      supper I will take you to her. There would be no use in going now, for Sir
      Norfolk has only just ordered supper, and I can merely introduce you as a
      partner for a dance. Sit down, and take a glass of champagne.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Randulph declined the latter offer, and was obliged to control his
      impatience until Firebras thought fit to rise. Crossing the amphitheatre,
      they proceeded to an alcove, in which Sir Norfolk and Hilda were seated,
      and Firebras, bowing to the old knight, said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Sir Norfolk, permit me to have the honour of presenting the friend I
      mentioned some hours ago to your fair charge. Miss Scarve,&rsquo; he added,
      after a significant look at Hilda, &lsquo;this gentleman wishes to have the
      honour of dancing a minuet with you. I am sorry there is no time for a
      more ceremonious introduction to yourself, Sir Norfolk, but the musicians
      are striking up the dance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0012" id="linkimage-0012"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0348.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Upon this Hilda arose, and tendered her hand, with some trepidation, to
      Randulph, who, with a breast thrilling with joyful emotion, led her to the
      open space cleared for the dancers, and part of which was already
      occupied, as before related, by Mr. Cripps and the widow. No time was
      allowed Randulph to hazard a word to his partner. Scarcely were they
      placed when the minuet commenced. The grace with which they performed this
      charming, though formal dance, excited the admiration of all the
      beholders, and contrasted strongly with the exaggerated style in which it
      was executed by Mr. Cripps and Mrs. Nettleship. Indeed, a better foil&mdash;had
      such been desired&mdash;could not have been found than the two latter
      personages presented. Sir Norfolk planted himself on one side to view the
      dance, and there was unwonted elation in his countenance as he witnessed
      the graceful movements of his fair cousin and her partner. Trussell in his
      Turkish dress was among the spectators; and not far from him stood
      Cardwell Firebras. There were two other personages, also, who watched the
      dance, but who regarded it with other sentiments than those of
      satisfaction. These were Lady Brabazon and Beau Villiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So you see, Villiers, notwithstanding all your scheming, he <i>has</i>
      contrived to dance with her,&rsquo; said the former.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has,&rsquo; replied the beau, partly removing his mask, and displaying a
      countenance inflamed with passion&mdash;&lsquo;but he has not exchanged a word
      with her, and I will take care he shall not exchange one.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are desperately in love with this girl, Villiers,&rsquo; said Lady Brabazon
      angrily. &lsquo;I thought it was her fortune merely you aimed at.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been foiled, and that has piqued me,&rsquo; replied Villiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Le jeu ne vaut pas la chandelle</i>,&rsquo; rejoined Lady Brabazon. &lsquo;After
      the failure of your attempt to carry her off, I wonder you will
      persevere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hush!&rsquo; exclaimed the beau. &lsquo;Some one may overhear us. I would have
      carried her off to-night, if I had known she would have been here. Your
      ladyship ought to be obliged to me for the trouble I am taking. I shall
      remove your rival, and you will then have young Crew entirely to yourself.
      And now to put Sir Norfolk on his guard.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With this, he passed on to the Welsh baronet, and addressed him. The
      latter bowed stiffly in return, and approached nearer the dancers; and
      while Hilda was curtseying to her partner at the close of the minuet, he
      took her hand and led her away. The young man would have followed them,
      but Cardwell Firebras came up, and arrested him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It won&rsquo;t do,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;Villiers has told the old baronet who you are. I
      must go after him instantly, and make some excuse for my share in the
      matter, or I shall have to cross swords with him to-morrow morning. I have
      done all I can for you. Goodnight.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon after this, Randulph quitted the masquerade with Trussell. With some
      difficulty a boat was procured to convey them home. Finding his nephew in
      no mood for conversation, Trussell, who was rather tired, and moreover had
      drunk a good deal of punch and champagne, disposed himself to slumber, nor
      did he awake till they reached Lambeth Stairs. Another boat had just
      landed, and two persons in dominos marched before them in the very
      direction they were going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, who the deuce have we here?&rsquo; cried Trussell, running forward to
      overtake the party in advance. &lsquo;Zounds, brother, is it you? Have you been
      at the masquerade?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have,&rsquo; replied Abel; &lsquo;and I have seen all that has occurred there.&rsquo;

      <span class="head">THE SUPPER AT VAUXHALL&mdash;BEAU VILLIERS&rsquo;s ATTEMPT TO
      CARRY OFF HILDA DEFEATED BY RANDULPH</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>elebrated
      throughout Europe, and once esteemed the most delightful place of
      recreation of the kind, Vauxhall Gardens were in existence considerably
      more than a century. They were first opened with a ridotto al fresco,
      about the year 1730, and speedily rising to a high reputation, were
      enlarged, and laid out in the most superb manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      A magnificent orchestra, of Gothic form, ornamented with carving and
      niches, and provided with a fine organ, was erected in the midst of the
      garden. There was likewise a rotunda, though not of equal dimensions with
      that of Ranelagh, being only seventy feet in diameter, with a dome-like
      roof, supported by four handsome Ionic columns, embellished with foliage
      at the base, while the shafts were wreathed with a Gothic balustrade,
      representing climbing figures. From the centre depended a magnificent
      chandelier.
    </p>
    <p>
      A part of the rotunda, used as a saloon, was decorated with columns,
      between which were paintings by Hayman. The entrance from the gardens was
      through a Gothic portal. Moreover, there were pavillions or alcoves,
      ornamented with paintings, from designs by Hogarth and Hayman, appropriate
      to the place; each alcove having a table in it capable of accommodating
      six or eight persons, and leading in an extensive sweep to a magnificent
      piazza, five hundred feet in length, of Chinese architecture. This
      semicircle led to a further sweep of pavilions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A noble gravel walk, nine hundred feet in length, bordered with lofty
      trees, and terminated by a broad lawn, in which there was a Gothic
      obelisk, faced the entrance. But the enchantment of the gardens commenced
      with the moment of their illumination, when upwards of two thousand lamps,
      lighted almost simultaneously, glimmered through the green leaves of the
      trees, and shed their radiance on the fairy scene around. This was the
      grand charm of Vauxhall. One of its minor attractions was a curious piece
      of machinery representing a miller&rsquo;s house, a water-wheel, and a cascade,
      which, at that period of the art, was thought quite marvellous. There were
      numberless walks and wildernesses in the grounds, and most of the vistas
      were adorned with statues. In one of them, at a date a little posterior to
      this history, was a statue of Handel as Orpheus holding a lyre.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was nearly ten o&rsquo;clock when Randulph reached the gardens. He proceeded
      along the grand walk, which was brilliantly illuminated, and filled with
      company, as far as the obelisk, but he could see nothing of Sir Norfolk or
      Hilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      He then turned into one of the side walks, and approached the orchestra,
      in front of which stood Kitty Conway, preparing to sing. She instantly
      detected him, and made a slight movement of recognition. As he passed the
      range of alcoves beneath the orchestra, he perceived Jacob, who instantly
      came towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve found it all out,&rsquo; said the porter&mdash;&lsquo;I knew I should. Mr.
      Willars <i>is</i> the contriver of the plot. He means to carry off Miss
      Hilda, and has engaged a coach for that purpose, which is stationed at the
      back o&rsquo; the gardens. Luckily, the coachman is a friend o&rsquo; mine, and it&rsquo;s
      through him I&rsquo;ve detected the scheme.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But where is your mistress?&rsquo; cried Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There,&rsquo; replied Jacob, pointing to a party seated at supper beneath the
      grove of trees in front of the orchestra.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I see,&rsquo; replied Randulph. &lsquo;By Heaven!&rsquo; he cried, &lsquo;Mr. Villiers is coming
      this way. Two persons stop him. As I live, one of them is his valet, and
      the other Captain Culpepper, a fellow whom my uncle Trussell told me was a
      sort of bravo, and would cut any man&rsquo;s throat for hire. Doubtless they are
      planning the abduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You may take your oath of it,&rsquo; replied Jacob. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll manage to get near
      &lsquo;em unobserved. Come back to this place when they separate, and you shall
      know all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he slouched his hat over his eyes, and mingling with the crowd,
      got within ear-shot of the beau, who, as has been intimated, was
      addressing Captain Culpepper and Mr. Cripps.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0013" id="linkimage-0013"> </a>

    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0356.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Randulph, meanwhile, felt irresistibly drawn towards the table where Hilda
      was seated, and as he kept behind the trees, he was not noticed by the
      party, though he <i>was</i> noticed by Kitty Conway, from the orchestra,
      who, guessing his intention, was so much agitated, that, for the first
      time in her professional career, she made some false notes in her singing.
      Hilda&rsquo;s seat was placed against a tree. On her right was Sir Norfolk
      Salusbury; and on the right of the baronet, Lady Brabazon; next her
      ladyship was a vacant chair&mdash;no doubt just quitted by Beau Villiers;
      then came Lady Fazakerly; then Sir Bulkeley Price; and lastly, Clementina
      Brabazon, who occupied the seat on the left of the miser&rsquo;s daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Partly screened by the tree against which Hilda was seated, Randulph bent
      forward, and breathed her name in the gentlest accents. Hilda heard the
      whisper, and looking round, beheld the speaker. How much may be conveyed
      in a glance! She read the intensity of his passion and the depth of his
      devotion in his eyes, and for the first time returned his gaze with a look
      of kindness, almost of tenderness; Randulph was transported; he could not
      resist the impulse that prompted him to advance and take her hand, which
      she unresistingly yielded to him. All this was the work of a minute; but
      the action had not been unobserved, either by Kitty Conway or Lady
      Brabazon. Both had felt a similar pang of jealousy, but revenge instantly
      occurred to the latter. While Randulph was in the act of raising Hilda&rsquo;s
      hand to his lips, she touched Sir Norfolk&rsquo;s arm, and, pointing in the
      direction of the lovers, whispered, &lsquo;Look there!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Norfolk arose, and in a stern and peremptory voice, said to the young
      man, &lsquo;Set free that lady&rsquo;s hand, sir!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not unless she chooses to withdraw it,&rsquo; replied Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am wholly to blame for this, Sir Norfolk,&rsquo; said Hilda, withdrawing her
      hand, and blushing deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are pleased to say so, Miss Scarve,&rsquo; returned Sir Norfolk; &lsquo;but the
      young man has been guilty of a great indecorum, and I shall call him to a
      strict account for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall be ready to answer the call whenever you please, Sir Norfolk,&rsquo; 
      rejoined Randulph. &lsquo;But this is not the place for menaces. You will do
      well to look after your charge.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall take care to keep off impertinents like you,&rsquo; replied Sir
      Norfolk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Better guard her against other dangers, which require more penetration
      than you care to practise,&rsquo; retorted Randulph. &lsquo;I have only one answer to
      make to such insolence,&rsquo; said Sir Norfolk, &lsquo;and that shall be given
      to-morrow. You shall hear from me, Mr. Crew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As soon as you please, Sir Norfolk,&rsquo; replied Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;For my sake, Mr. Crew,&rsquo; interposed Hilda, &lsquo;let this quarrel go no
      further. I have been the innocent cause of it. Promise me it shall not.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I would willingly obey you in anything, Miss Scarve,&rsquo; replied Randulph;
      &lsquo;but in this case it is not in my power. Farewell!&rsquo; Fixing one passionate
      look upon her, he then bowed haughtily to Sir Norfolk, who returned his
      salutation in kind, and withdrew.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he walked away, he encountered Beau Villiers, who was returning from
      his conference. Villiers started on seeing him, but instantly recovered
      himself, and would have addressed him, but Randulph turned abruptly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What the devil has brought Randulph Crew here?&rsquo; said Villiers to Sir
      Singleton, as he joined the party. &lsquo;I thought he was at Drury Lane.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Devil knows!&rsquo; cried the old beau. &lsquo;But he has made a pretty scene.&rsquo; And
      he proceeded to relate what had occurred. Villiers laughed heartily at the
      recital.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope old Salusbury will cut his throat,&rsquo; he said, in an undertone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, it would be desirable to get him out of the way, certainly,&rsquo; replied
      the old beau. &lsquo;The women are all mad about him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Especially Kitty Conway,&rsquo; observed Villiers. &lsquo;Odds life! this accounts
      for her having feinted in the orchestra. I wondered what could be the
      matter with her, but now I understand it. All is prepared,&rsquo; he added, in a
      deep whisper to Lady Brabazon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be careful how you act,&rsquo; she replied, in a low tone. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll find Sir
      Norfolk dangerous, and Randulph Crew is on the watch.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fear nothing,&rsquo; he rejoined, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve taken my measures securely. Make
      towards the dark walk, and contrive to lead him and the others away.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Brabazon nodded. Soon after this she arose, and, without ceremony,
      took Sir Norfolk&rsquo;s arm, while Villiers very gallantly offered his to
      Hilda. The rest of the party paired off in like manner. Leading the way in
      the direction agreed upon, Lady Brabazon expressed a desire to view the
      scenic representation of the mill and waterfall before mentioned, which
      was exhibited in a hollow of the great walk; and they proceeded towards
      it. Hilda was much displeased by the assiduities of her companion, and she
      could not help remarking that he contrived, on various pretences, to
      linger behind the rest of the party, and though she repeatedly urged him
      to rejoin them, he always made some excuse for not doing so. At last, on
      pausing longer than usual, they quite lost sight of them, and were
      hurrying forward at Hilda&rsquo;s urgent request, when, as they passed one of
      the side vistas, Mr. Cripps, who was standing at the end of it, advanced
      towards his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Fortunately encountered, sir,&rsquo; said the valet, bowing; &lsquo;Lady Brabazon
      sent me to look for you, to tell you that she and the party are gone down
      a walk on the left to see a fine painting in the Chinese pavilion at the
      end of it. With your permission, I&rsquo;ll show you the way.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, yes, let us go to them, by all means,&rsquo; said Hilda unsuspectingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lead on, then!&rsquo; cried the beau, scarcely able to conceal his satisfaction
      at the success of the scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few steps brought them to the end of a narrow walk, arched over by
      trees, the branches of which were so thickly interlaced, that the
      moonlight could not penetrate through them. Alarmed by its appearance,
      Hilda drew back. &lsquo;How thoughtless of Sir Norfolk to leave me thus!&rsquo; she
      exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why, you are surely not afraid of accompanying me down this walk, Miss
      Scarve,&rsquo; laughed the beau. &lsquo;My valet is with us, and shall protect you.
      The Chinese pavilion is not more than a hundred yards off; and the walk,
      though dark, is not solitary.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Fancying she perceived some persons within it, Hilda suffered herself to
      be led on; but she had not advanced many steps when all her uneasiness
      returned, and she bitterly regretted having assented. But it was too late.
      The beau&rsquo;s grasp had tightened upon her arm, and he drew her quickly
      forward, while Mr. Cripps proceeded at the same rapid pace. Once or twice,
      she thought she heard footsteps behind her, and almost fancied she could
      distinguish a figure walking near them, but she did not dare to express
      her terrors.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had proceeded, so for as she could judge, about a hundred yards, when
      a sudden turn in the walk disclosed a low hedge; beyond was the open
      country bathed in moonlight. Coming to a sudden halt, the beau said, in a
      hurried, but imperative tone&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Scarve, I love you to desperation, and am determined to make you
      mine. You are now in my power, and must accompany me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Never,&rsquo; replied Hilda resolutely. &lsquo;And I command you to release me.&rsquo; She
      would have screamed for help, if Villiers, who grasped her more tightly,
      had not taken out his handkerchief, and, placing it over her mouth,
      prevented her cries. While this was passing, Captain Culpepper emerged
      from the trees, and hastened with Mr. Cripps towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bravo, sir,&rsquo; cried the captain. &lsquo;All goes well this time. We&rsquo;ll have her
      in the coach in a twinkling.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not so fast, villains!&rsquo; thundered Randulph, rushing forward. &lsquo;I have
      allowed you to go thus far to see to what lengths your villainy would
      carry you. But you shall pay dearly for it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he rushed to the beau, and snatching Hilda from him, dashed
      him backwards with such force that he fell upon the ground. Another person
      likewise came to the rescue. This was Jacob, who, brandishing his cudgel,
      hurried to the scene of action. On seeing him the valet whipped out his
      blade, but it was beaten from his grasp, and he only avoided a terrible
      blow from the cudgel by a nimble leap aside. Without waiting for a second
      blow, he plunged into the wood, and made his escape.
    </p>
    <p>
      Captain Culpepper fared no better. Before he could draw his sword, he
      received a blow on the head that stretched him senseless and bleeding on
      the ground. Hilda, meantime, had murmured her thanks to her deliverer, who
      felt, as he pressed her to his bosom, that the whole of his previous
      anxiety was more than repaid by the unutterable joy of the moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hilda!&rsquo; he cried passionately, &lsquo;I would risk a thousand lives for you.
      Forgive me if, at this moment, I dare to ask if I may hope?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She murmured a faint response in the affirmative.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am the happiest of men!&rsquo; cried Randulph, transported with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Alas!&rsquo; exclaimed Hilda, &lsquo;my avowal can give you little happiness. I can
      never be yours.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There you speak truth!&rsquo; cried Villiers, who by this time had regained his
      feet, and furiously approached them. &lsquo;You never shall be his.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is the leader of the gang!&rsquo; cried Jacob, who having just disposed of
      Captain Culpepper, now rushed towards the beau, brandishing his cudgel in
      a formidable manner. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll soon settle him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave him alone, Jacob,&rsquo; cried Randulph authoritatively; &lsquo;his punishment
      belongs to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;re wrong, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Jacob, &lsquo;but I shan&rsquo;t disobey you. He doesn&rsquo;t
      deserve to be treated like a gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;man.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oblige me by stepping aside for a moment, Mr. Crew!&rsquo; said the beau, with
      forced politeness. And as Randulph complied, added&mdash;&lsquo;I shall expect
      satisfaction for the injury you have here done me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I might well refuse it,&rsquo; replied Randulph; &lsquo;but I am too eager for
      vengeance myself to do so. You shall have the satisfaction you seek as
      soon as you please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To-morrow morning, then, at the earliest hour&mdash;at five&mdash;in
      Tothill Fields,&rsquo; said Villiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will be there,&rsquo; replied Randulph. And, quitting the beau, he rejoined
      Hilda, to whom he offered his arm. They walked down the avenue together,
      Jacob following close beside them. Hilda allowed her hand to remain in
      his, while he poured the warmest protestations of attachment into her ear.
      She did not attempt to check him; and perhaps it would be difficult to say
      which of the two felt the most regret when that brief dream of happiness
      was ended, as they emerged into the lighted vista.
    </p>
    <p>
      Almost immediately on entering the great walk, they met Sir Norfolk and
      Lady Brabazon and the rest of the party. Her ladyship was at first greatly
      confused at seeing Randulph, but she instantly guessed what had happened,
      and tried to put a good face on the matter. Advancing to Hilda, she
      hastily inquired what had happened; but the latter turned coldly from her,
      and taking the arm of Sir Norfolk Salusbury, desired to be led home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Your ladyship is perfectly aware of the peril in which I have been
      placed,&rsquo; she said. &lsquo;But I have been delivered from it by the courage and
      address of Mr. Crew.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Before you go, Miss Scarve,&rsquo; said Lady Brabazon, &lsquo;I beseech you to give
      me some explanation of what has happened.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It must suffice, then, to say, that Mr. Villiers has attempted to carry
      me off,&rsquo; replied Hilda&mdash;&lsquo;but his purpose has been defeated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this I hear?&rsquo; cried Sir Norfolk. &lsquo;Mr. Villiers guilty of so base
      an attempt? I will go in search of him instantly!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have undertaken the punishment of Mr. Villiers&rsquo;s offence, sir,&rsquo; said
      Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have an account to settle with me yourself, sir,&rsquo; rejoined Sir
      Norfolk sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will settle it at five o&rsquo;clock to-morrow morning, in Tothill Fields,&rsquo; 
      replied Randulph, in a low tone, &lsquo;after I have arranged with Mr.
      Villiers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Be it so,&rsquo; replied Sir Norfolk. And he strode off with Hilda, followed by
      Jacob; while Randulph, without staying to exchange a word with Lady
      Brabazon, walked away in the opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">THE DUEL IN TOTHILL FIELDS, WESTMINSTER</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was a fresh and
      beautiful morning, though the sun was scarcely risen, and a thin silvery
      mist hung like a veil over the smooth surface of the water. Two or three
      watermen were lying asleep in their tilts, and they roused one of them,
      who speedily rowed them to the opposite bank, near which they found Mr.
      Hewitt, with two brace of swords under his arm, in addition to the one by
      his side, accompanied by a tall stout man, with a red face, dressed in a
      well-powdered wig, and a suit of purple velvet, and carrying a gold-headed
      cane, who was introduced as Mr. Molson, the surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You look famously,&rsquo; said the fencing-master to Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Follow my instructions, and you&rsquo;re sure to come off victoriously.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The party then walked along the Horseferry Road, which speedily brought
      them to Tothill Fields. They were the first on the ground, and Mr. Hewitt,
      after looking about for a short time, discovered a spot excellently
      adapted for the encounters. By this time, the sun having risen, the
      morning&rsquo;s early promise of beauty was fully confirmed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spot selected for the combats commanded a fine view of Westminster
      Abbey, which reared its massive body and tall towers above a range of mean
      habitations masking its base. Cawing jackdaws in clouds wheeled in the
      sunny air above its pinnacles.
    </p>
    <p>
      A calmer or more beautiful scene could not be imagined. Randulph&rsquo;s
      reflections were interrupted by the approach of two persons from the left
      of the fields, who proved to be Sir Norfolk Salusbury and Cardwell
      Firebras. Sir Norfolk bowed stiffly to Randulph, and also to Trussell, and
      seeing that the beau was not arrived, said to the former, &lsquo;As I am first
      in the field, I am entitled to the first bout.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am sorry I cannot oblige you, Sir Norfolk,&rsquo; replied Randulph; &lsquo;but I <i>must</i>
      give Mr. Villiers priority.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, as you please, sir,&rsquo; said the baronet, walking aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cardwell Firebras then advanced to Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am here as Sir Norfolk&rsquo;s second,&rsquo; he said; &lsquo;but I hope the matter may
      only serve as a little breathing for you both before breakfast. It is an
      idle quarrel. We must talk about Villiers&rsquo;s attempt anon. But here he is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, two chairs were seen approaching from the lower end of the
      fields. When they came within a hundred yards of the party they stopped,
      and from the first issued Mr. Villiers, and from the other Sir Bulkeley
      Price. Mr. Cripps walked by the side of his master&rsquo;s chair, bearing a
      water-bottle and a glass. The new-comers advanced slowly towards the
      party, and Mr. Villiers, having bowed with much haughtiness to Randulph,
      gracefully saluted the rest of the company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have we anything to wait for, gentlemen?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Nothing,&rsquo; replied Trussell; &lsquo;we are all ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;To business, then,&rsquo; rejoined the beau.
    </p>
    <p>
      At a motion from his master, Mr. Cripps advanced towards him, and
      receiving his clouded cane, proceeded to divest him of his coat, leaving
      him on a light striped silk waistcoat, with sleeves of the same material.
      Randulph, meantime, threw off his upper garment, and rolled up the shirt
      sleeve on his right arm. Mr. Hewitt then stepped up to him, and gave him
      the German sword he had promised; while Mr. Villiers received an
      exquisitely tempered blade from the valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      These preparations made, the seconds and bystanders fell back a few paces,
      Trussell, Firebras, and Hewitt standing on one side, and the two baronets
      on the other, while the surgeon stood at a little distance in the rear
      with Mr. Cripps. Advancing towards each other, the combatants saluted, and
      in another moment their blades were crossed, and several rapid passes
      exchanged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The spectators watched the conflict with the greatest interest, for both
      parties appeared admirably matched, and the beau&rsquo;s superior skill was
      counterbalanced by Randulph&rsquo;s extraordinary vigour and quickness. Thrusts
      were made and parried on both sides, but not a single hit was given, until
      Randulph, finding his adversary engaged in tierce with a high point, made
      a firm thrust in carte over the arm, and passed his sword through the
      fleshy part of the other&rsquo;s shoulder. At this successful hit, the seconds
      rushed forward, but before they reached the spot, the beau&rsquo;s sword fell
      from his grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is nothing,&rsquo; said Villiers, surrendering himself to the surgeon, who
      likewise hurried towards him; &lsquo;but I acknowledge myself defeated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While the beau&rsquo;s wound was bound up by the surgeon, and he was led to the
      chair by Mr. Cripps, Sir Norfolk Salusbury, who had been a watchful
      spectator of the conflict, stepped forward, and said to Randulph&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whatever may be the issue of our encounter, Mr. Crew, I shall declare
      that in the combat which has just taken place, you have conducted yourself
      like a man of honour and spirit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am glad to receive the acknowledgment from you, Sir Norfolk,&rsquo; replied
      Randulph, bowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pray do not hurry yourself on my account,&rsquo; said the baronet courteously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am quite ready for you,&rsquo; replied Randulph. &lsquo;What I have gone through
      has only served to steady my nerves.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With the assistance of Firebras, who had come over to him, Sir Norfolk
      then took off his coat, waistcoat, and shirt, and in this state presented
      so extraordinary an appearance, that Randulph could scarcely repress a
      smile. The punctilious old knight&rsquo;s first step was to deliver his sword to
      Mr. Hewitt, who, on measuring it with that of Randulph, found that it
      exceeded the latter in length by two inches. He therefore gave him one of
      his own swords, and Sir Norfolk, beating an appeal with his right foot,
      bade his youthful opponent come on. Having gone through their salutes with
      the greatest formality, they commenced the combat with the utmost caution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Norfolk acted chiefly upon the defensive, and contented himself almost
      entirely with parrying the thrusts aimed at him. Randulph soon found that
      he had a formidable antagonist to deal with, and altering his plan, tried
      to compel him to attack him. He made several feints with great dexterity,
      and just touched his adversary&rsquo;s breast with an inside thrust in carte,
      causing a slight effusion of blood.
    </p>
    <p>
      This had the effect of rousing the old baronet into exertion, and in his
      turn he became the assailant. He attacked Randulph with such force and
      fury, that he drove him back several paces. The young man returned to the
      charge, and pressed his adversary in his turn, so that he regained his
      ground; but while making a pass in carte, his sword was turned near the
      wrist by a dexterous and sudden lunge on the part of the baronet, whose
      point entered his side just below the elbow, and inflicted a severe wound.
      Maddened by the pain, Randulph continued to fight desperately, but the
      seconds rushed between the combatants, and interposing their blades,
      declared that the strife must terminate, and that Sir Norfolk was the
      victor. The baronet immediately dropped his sword, and Randulph, whose
      strength had been fast failing, fell to the ground insensible.

      THE MISER&rsquo;S ILLNESS, AND OF THE DISCOVERY OF THE MYSTERIOUS PACKET BY
      HILDA</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>is mind lightened,
      apparently, by what had taken place, Mr. Scarve remained perfectly quiet
      during the rest of the day, and retired early to rest; but he passed
      another sleepless night, and was seized with a new panic about his money.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day, finding himself unable to go downstairs, he ordered Jacob to
      bring up all his boxes, and to place them near him. His fever increasing,
      and assuming somewhat the character of an ague, he consented to have a
      small fire kept up constantly in his bedroom, and set his chair close
      beside it. In addition to his dressing-gown he wrapped an old blanket over
      his shoulders, and tried to keep his lower limbs warm by clothing them in
      a couple of pairs of worsted hose. His bed being totally destitute of
      hangings, he had a sheet hung up against the lower end of it to keep off
      the blaze of the fire, which he fancied disturbed him during the night.
      These slight comforts were all he permitted himself, and he remained as
      inflexible as ever on the score of medicine and medical advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A doctor can do no good,&rsquo; he said to Jacob, who urged him to send for
      one; &lsquo;if abstinence won&rsquo;t cure a man, no physic will.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, perhaps you&rsquo;re right, sir,&rsquo; said Jacob; &lsquo;but I wish you&rsquo;d think
      less o&rsquo; your worldly affairs, and more o&rsquo; your sperretual ones. Look at
      that pictur&rsquo; over your chimney-piece, and see how Death is takin&rsquo; away the
      covetous man&rsquo;s treasures before his very eyes. It might be intended as a
      warnin&rsquo; to you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But he grew daily worse and worse, and his faculties became more and more
      enfeebled. He rambled about the house at night, almost in a state of
      somnambulism, muttering strange things about his treasure, and frequently
      visiting the cellar where he had buried the chest, unconscious that it was
      gone. At such times, Jacob constantly followed, to prevent him from doing
      himself a mischief, but took care not to be seen. His groans and
      lamentations were pitiful to hear, for he had begun to fancy himself a
      ruined man, and not even the sight of his money could assure him to the
      contrary. It was vain to reason with him. The distressing idea was too
      strongly impressed upon his mind to be removed. His next whim was to have
      his boxes opened by Hilda, to whom he had entrusted his keys, and he
      insisted upon certain deeds and papers being read to him, the meaning of
      which he only very imperfectly comprehended.
    </p>
    <p>
      One night, when seated by the fireside wrapped in his blanket, and with
      his feet on a straw hassock, he desired his daughter to read him some more
      papers. The fire burnt as cheerily as it could in the starveling grate,
      and Hilda insisting upon having two candles to read by, there was more
      light than usual. Having got through several mortgages, leases, and bonds,
      to the innumerable clauses of which he listened in his usual apathetic
      manner, he suddenly turned round to her, and pointing to the strong box
      which formerly stood under his table in the room downstairs, signed to her
      to open it. Well aware that this box contained his most private papers,
      Hilda had hitherto avoided meddling with it, but thus enjoined, she no
      longer hesitated. Placing it on the table, therefore, she took the large
      bunch of keys, and soon finding the right one, unlocked it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Is there anything in particular you wish me to read, dear father?&rsquo; she
      said, taking out some papers tied together with red tape. &lsquo;Here is a bond
      for two thousand pounds from George Delahay Villiers, Esquire; another
      from Lady Brabazon; and another from Sir Bulkeley Price. Shall I read any
      of them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The miser shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here are several bills,&rsquo; she continued, taking up a roll of smaller
      papers&mdash;&lsquo;and another bundle of mortgages, will you hear any of them?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">THE DISCOVERY OF THE MYSTERIOUS PACKET</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The miser shook his head. The movement was almost mechanical with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then I will go on,&rsquo; pursued Hilda. &lsquo;Ah! what is this letter with the
      black seal? Shall I read it?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0014" id="linkimage-0014"> </a>

    <p>
      The miser made no reply. He was gazing listlessly into the fire, and
      watching the wreaths of smoke ascend the chimney with childish delight.
      Hilda, therefore, opened the letter, and found a small memorandum enclosed
      in it, which she placed upon the table. Trembling with emotion, she then
      began to read aloud the following lines:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Old and valued Friend&mdash;If this should ever meet your eye, I shall
      have been a year in my grave, for, in accordance with our agreement, it
      will not be delivered to you until the expiration of that time after my
      death. The agreement, I need not remind you, was so formed that in case we
      should both die within the year, the contract entered into by us
      respecting the marriage of our children should be null and void.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Hilda was startled by a sharp cry from her father, and looking up,
      she saw that he was staring wildly and inquiringly at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What are you reading?&rsquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The letter delivered to you by Randulph Crew,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;the letter
      from his father.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And what business have you to read it?&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;Who gave you leave to
      do so?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Having gone so far, I shall go on,&rsquo; rejoined Hilda; and she resumed her
      reading, &lsquo;&ldquo;now call upon you to fulfil your share of the contract, and to
      give your daughter to my son. When we entered into the engagement, I was
      supposed to be the richer of the two; but I am now sadly reduced, and if
      my son fulfils his word, and gives up the estates to pay my creditors, he
      will have little or nothing.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He has nothing&mdash;he has nothing!&rsquo; cried the miser, &lsquo;I will never give
      my consent&mdash;never!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;But under whatever circumstances he may be placed,&rdquo;&rsquo; said Hilda,
      continuing the letter, &lsquo;&ldquo;whether he gives up the property or not, I call
      upon you to fulfil your part of the contract, as I would have fulfilled
      mine, whatever might have happened to you; and to make, as you have agreed
      to do, a settlement upon your daughter proportioned to your means.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I made no such agreement!&rsquo; cried the miser; &lsquo;it is false&mdash;false!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I enclose a copy of the memorandum,&rdquo;&rsquo; pursued Hilda, still reading;
      &lsquo;&ldquo;the original, as you know, is in the possession of Cardwell Firebras. He
      will see it executed. God so requite you as you shall fulfil your
      agreement or neglect it!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Randulph Crew.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And here is the memorandum,&rsquo; she added, taking up the smaller piece of
      paper. &lsquo;It is signed by Randulph Crew and John Scarve.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is a forgery!&rsquo; shrieked the miser.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The original is in the possession of Cardwell Firebras,&rsquo; said Hilda.
      &lsquo;Father, you have dealt unjustly by Randulph Crew. You owe him a great
      reparation, and I trust you will make it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I owe him nothing,&rsquo; replied the miser; &lsquo;it is all a fabrication. Give me
      the papers, that I may burn them! Give them to me directly.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And getting up, he staggered towards her, and snatched the letter and
      memorandum from her, with the intention of throwing them into the fire.
      But before he could do so, the door opened, and admitted Abel Beechcroft.

      <span class="head">RANDULPH DEFENDING HIMSELF AGAINST PHILIP FREWIN AND
      HIS MYRMIDONS&mdash;RANDULPH AGAIN DINES WITH LADY BRABAZON&mdash;HE
      RECEIVES A NOTE FROM KITTY CONWAY, AND IS ASSAULTED BY PHILIP FREWIN AND
      HIS MYRMIDONS ON HIS WAY TO SUP WITH HER.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he dinner passed
      off delightfully. It was a small party, consisting of Sir Bulkeley Price,
      Sir Norfolk Salusbury, and Lady Fazakerly. Everything was done to please
      Randulph, and the efforts were perfectly successful. The wine flowed
      freely after dinner&mdash;for it was a hard drinking age&mdash;and
      Randulph, who had been exceedingly temperate since the duel, began to feel
      the effect of it. As he was about to ascend to the drawing-room with the
      rest of the gentlemen, a note was handed him by a servant, which he
      instantly opened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What says your billet, nephew?&rsquo; inquired Trussell, who was standing by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh! it&rsquo;s from Kitty Conway,&rsquo; said Randulph. &lsquo;She has found out, I know
      not how, that I am here, and wishes me to sup with her to-night for the
      last time.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And you will go, won&rsquo;t you?&rsquo; said Trussell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not I,&rsquo; replied Randulph irresolutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh yes, you will,&rsquo; said Trussell; &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll accompany you on your last
      visit, as I did on the first.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And they went upstairs laughingly to the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Time passed by so fleetly in the fascinating society of Lady Brabazon,
      that Randulph was surprised, on glancing at his watch, to find it nearly
      eleven o&rsquo;clock. &lsquo;Jacob will be gone,&rsquo; he thought, &lsquo;and will think I have
      forgotten him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Hastily taking leave of Lady Brabazon, who chided him playfully for
      running away so early, and engaged him to call upon her on the following
      morning, he went downstairs accompanied by Trussell. They found Jacob at
      the door, and in no very bland humour at having been kept so long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My time&rsquo;s more than up,&rsquo; said the latter gruffly, &lsquo;and I was just goin&rsquo; 
      away. What I want to say is this,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve received a hint that master&rsquo;s
      miserly nevy, Philip Frewin, is about to decamp with the money I gave Mr.
      Diggs t&rsquo;other day. He&rsquo;s at the Crown Inn, Ox-yard, King Street. Suppose
      you pay him a visit.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll readily do so to-morrow, Jacob,&rsquo; said Randulph; &lsquo;but tonight I&rsquo;m
      engaged. Come along with me. My way lies in the same direction as yours,
      and I want to talk to you about your master and young mistress.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob complied, and accompanied Randulph to the corner of Hedge Lane, a
      narrow thoroughfare running into Cockspur Street, where he took his leave.
      Randulph and his uncle then tracked the lane above mentioned, until they
      came to Whitcomb Street, where Kitty Conway then resided, having removed
      from the Hay-market to an old house in the latter street, erected three
      years after the Great Fire of London&mdash;namely, 1669.
    </p>
    <p>
      Never having visited the pretty actress in her new abode, but having been
      told in the note that this date, which was inscribed in large figures on a
      shield over the door, would guide him to it, Randulph was looking out for
      the house, when he observed three men at a little distance behind him, who
      seemed to be dogging him and his uncle. The foremost was a tall thin man;
      the second a stout, square-set personage, attired in a shabby military
      garb; and the third a great hulking fellow with an atrociously black
      muzzle, dressed in a blue jacket, short trousers, and woollen cap.
    </p>
    <p>
      Randulph could not help fancying he had seen these personages before,
      though he could not tell where, but he did not concern himself much about
      them, until just as he had discovered Kitty Conway&rsquo;s dwelling, and was
      about to knock at the door, he saw that they were quickening their pace
      towards him. On a nearer approach, he was at no loss to detect Philip
      Frewin, and in his companions, Captain Culpepper and the fellow who had
      officiated as Jack-in-the-water at the Folly on the Thames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is your man!&rsquo; shouted Philip, pointing out Randulph to the others;
      &lsquo;upon him! don&rsquo;t leave an unbroken bone in his body.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0015" id="linkimage-0015"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0381.jpg" alt="0381 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
    <h5>
      <a href="images/0381.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      Randulph, however, was prepared for the attack. Grasping the stout cane he
      held in his hand, he dealt Philip so severe a blow on the head with it
      that he stretched him on his back on the ground. At the same moment,
      Trussell received a blow from the cudgel of the athletic sailor, which
      sent him reeling against the door, to the posts of which he clung for
      support, while the ruffian turning to assault Randulph, encountered an
      unexpected adversary in the person of Jacob Post.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thought what you were after, you scoundrels, when I saw you doggin&rsquo; 
      these gen&rsquo;l&rsquo;men,&rsquo; cried Jacob; &lsquo;I&rsquo;m glad I got up in time. Turn your
      cudgel this way, you black-muzzled hound! Two can play at your game.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jacob and his antagonist rapped away at each other as hard as they
      could, making the welkin ring with their blows, Randulph turned upon
      Culpepper, who attempted to draw his sword to assail him, and belaboured
      him so lustily with his cane, that the latter was soon fain to cry for
      quarter.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sound of the cudgels, and the vociferations of the combatants, had
      alarmed the watch, who sprang their rattles, and hastened to the scene of
      strife, while Kitty Conway, hearing the noise, opened a window above, and
      seeing what was passing in the street, added her shrieks to the general
      clamour. Before, however, the watch could come up, Jacob had brought his
      athletic antagonist to the ground, and Culpepper had taken to his heels
      without being able to strike a single blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">MR. CRIPPS DETECTED&mdash;HOW MR. CRIPPS&rsquo;S MARRIAGE
      WITH THE WIDOW WAS INTERRUPTED</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was arranged
      that the ceremony should take place in the upper chamber, where Randulph
      first breakfasted with the beau, and the clergyman selected to perform it
      was Doctor Gaynam. Thus nothing seemed wanting on the valet&rsquo;s part to
      complete the matter; and late on Wednesday evening he went to Billiter
      Square, to inform Mrs. Nettleship that all was ready. After a brief visit,
      for he was somewhat fatigued, he took a tender adieu of her, saying, as he
      squeezed her hand at parting&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We shall meet to-morrow, to part no more!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, betimes, Mr. Cripps placed himself under the hands of
      Antoine, who proceeded to array him in a magnificent suit, which had never
      been worn by his master, it having only been sent home the night before by
      Desmartins.
    </p>
    <p>
      It consisted of a coat of crimson-embossed velvet, richly laced with gold,
      breeches of the same material, and a white satin waistcoat flowered with
      gold. To these were added, pink silk hose rolled above the knee, superb
      diamond buckles, and point-bee cravat, and his master&rsquo;s handsomest
      Ramillies periwig, which had been dressed by Peter Pokerich.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nearly three hours were expended in thus attiring him; and when all was
      completed, Antoine declared that his master had never looked half so well&mdash;a
      sentiment in which Mr. Cripps, as he complacently surveyed himself in the
      cheval-glass, entirely concurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before twelve, Peter Pokerich and the fair Thomasine arrived. The
      lady was dressed in white and silver, with a fly-cap with long lappets,
      and looked so excessively pretty that Mr. Cripps could not help wishing
      she had been the bride instead of Mrs. Nettleship.
    </p>
    <p>
      While he was welcoming them, and passing some high-flown compliments on
      the fair Thomasine&rsquo;s charms, Mr. Jukes was shown into the room; but as he
      was in his butler&rsquo;s dress, his nephew did not condescend to speak to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Shortly after this Antoine announced that the bride had arrived, and Mr.
      Cripps hurried downstairs to meet her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Nettleship, who had bestowed more than ordinary pains upon her
      person, wore a yellow satin sack embroidered with little dots of gold. She
      had large pearl earrings, a garnet necklace, and a diamond solitaire. Her
      complexion, which was naturally rather high, had been corrected by white
      French powder, and was further set off with abundance of little patches on
      her checks, neck, and shoulders. She carried a beautiful Indian fan, the
      handle of which was ornamented with precious stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had arrived in great state, a gilt chariot lined with pale blue satin,
      hired for her from a coachmaker, by Mr. Rathbone, having formed her
      conveyance; and she was attended by a couple of footmen out of place,
      likewise hired for the occasion, habited in superb liveries of sky-blue
      cloth trimmed with silver, with silver shoulder-knots, and point d&rsquo;Espagne
      hats.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Rathbone, who accompanied her, was dressed in a suit of purple velvet,
      laced with gold. Almost bewildered by the grandeur she beheld around, the
      widow was led upstairs by Mr. Cripps; her wonder increased at every step
      she took. The two long-eared spaniels and the macaw enchanted her; but she
      actually screamed with delight on beholding the monkey, in his little
      scarlet coat and bag-wig.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coffee, chocolate, and champagne were then handed round by Antoine and the
      page; and while this was going on, the clergyman and his assistant were
      announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Gaynam had a much more respectable appearance than when he
      officiated at Sir Singleton Spinke&rsquo;s marriage. He was dressed in his full
      canonicals, and wore a well-powdered full-bottomed wig, which Peter
      Pokerich would not have disdained.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mr. Cripps had seated himself by the bride on one of the
      couches, and was talking very tenderly to her, when he perceived his uncle
      approach Mr. Rathbone, as if with the intention of addressing him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He instantly arose, and taking the latter aside, whispered a few words to
      him, and then, having accomplished his object, which was to prevent any
      communication between him and Mr. Jukes, told the clergyman to proceed
      with the ceremony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doctor Gaynam was sipping a glass of usquebaugh, but he hastily gulped it
      down, and declared himself perfectly ready. He then took a prayer-book
      from the clerk, and stationed himself between the windows, motioning the
      others to take their places before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">MR. CRIPPS DETECTED</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      All was soon arranged. Peter Pokerich and the fair Thomasine stood near
      the bride; Mr. Rathbone near the bridegroom; Antoine behind him; while the
      group was completed by the two Africans, who had mounted a settee in the
      corner, to obtain a full view of the ceremony. The page was on the floor
      keeping the dogs quiet, who were quarrelling with the monkey, and biting
      its tail.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just as Doctor Gaynam had opened his book, and uttered a preliminary
      cough, a noise was heard at the door, and Mr. Cripps, turning to see what
      was the matter, beheld it open, and admit his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0016" id="linkimage-0016"> </a>
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">

    <h5>
      <a href="images/0389.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      The valet&rsquo;s alarm was instantly communicated to the whole assemblage.
      Antoine shrugged his shoulders, and lifted up his hands in affright. The
      two Africans exchanged glances of alarm, and all eyes were directed
      towards the beau, who with angry looks, and grasping his clouded cane,
      marched towards the valet. He was followed by Lady Brabazon, Sir Bulkeley
      Price, and Trussell Beechcroft.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lady Brabazon was attended by her black page, leading her dog by a riband,
      and this arrival excited the anger of one of the spaniels, whose furious
      barking set the macaw screaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Cripps presented a very chopfallen appearance. All his assurance
      deserted him. His hands dropped to his side, and he scarcely dared to meet
      his master&rsquo;s angry gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Rascal!&rsquo; exclaimed Villiers, &lsquo;I have at last fairly detected you. I&rsquo;ll
      teach you to put on my clothes&mdash;to assume my name&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What!&rsquo; screamed Mrs. Nettleship, dropping a bottle of salts which she had
      placed to her nose&mdash;&lsquo;isn&rsquo;t it really himself&mdash;isn&rsquo;t it Mr.
      Willars?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, madam,&rsquo; replied the beau&mdash;&lsquo;I am Mr. Villiers; and this rascal is
      only my valet, Crackenthorpe Cripps.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This looks like the real gentleman, I must say,&rsquo; cried Mr. Rathbone, who
      was thunderstruck with surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the villain!&mdash;the base deceiver!&mdash;the impostor!&rsquo; shrieked
      Mrs. Nettleship, clenching her hands, and regarding the valet as if she
      would annihilate him. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll tear his eyes out! To deceive and expose me in
      this way&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;to&mdash;oh! I shall never survive it.
      Support me!&rsquo; she added, falling into the arms of the fair Thomasine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is really too bad of you, sir,&rsquo; said Mr. Cripps, who began to
      recover himself a little. &lsquo;You&rsquo;ve deceived <i>me</i>. I thought you were
      at Newmarket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I received information of your practices, rascal,&rsquo; replied the beau, &lsquo;and
      resolving to see to what extent you carried them, I only went to a short
      distance from town, and then returned with Sir Bulkeley Price, with whom I
      have remained till now. And a pretty discovery I&rsquo;ve made, i&rsquo;faith! My
      house filled with company&mdash;my servants turned into your servants&mdash;a
      dinner, supper, confectionery, wine, fruit, musicians, and the devil knows
      what, ordered at my expense.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, they&rsquo;re not thrown away, sir,&rsquo; replied Mr. Cripps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You can marry the lady yourself, if you think proper. I&rsquo;ve no doubt
      she&rsquo;ll consent to the exchange, and she has fifty thousand pounds.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, the impudence!&rsquo; exclaimed Mrs. Nettleship, jumping up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll not be taken in a second time. I&rsquo;ll be revenged on all the sex!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not aware, Mr. Willars, of the extensive frauds this rascal has
      practised upon you,&rsquo; said Mr. Rathbone. &lsquo;He has actually signed a bond for
      five thousand pounds in your name, which I have in my pocket.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The devil he has!&rsquo; exclaimed Villiers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But it is of no effect, since the marriage has not taken place,&rsquo; said Mr.
      Cripps; &lsquo;and if Mr. Villiers chooses to take the lady, he will of course
      pay you himself.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of himself, the beau could not help laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bad as Mr. Cripps is, he is not worse than the other party,&rsquo; said
      Trussell, stepping forward; &lsquo;while he was duping them, they tried to dupe
      him. I understand from Mr. Jukes, who has it on unquestionable authority,
      that Mrs. Nettleship, so far from being a wealthy widow, is greatly in
      debt, while her friend there, Mr. Rathbone, hoped to pocket the five
      thousand pounds secured by the bond he has mentioned.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gadso! then it seems I&rsquo;ve had an escape!&rsquo; cried Mr. Cripps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have,&rsquo; replied Trussell; &lsquo;and your uncle would have told you all this
      before, if you had not kept him at a distance.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I won&rsquo;t stay here to be laughed at!&rsquo; cried the widow, looking defiance at
      the jeering countenances around her. &lsquo;Mr. Rathbone, your arm. I&rsquo;ll make
      you marry me yourself, or pay the penalty of the contract,&rsquo; she added, in
      a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You&rsquo;ll not mistake a valet for a gentleman after this, Monsieur
      Rathbone,&rsquo; said Antoine&mdash;&lsquo;ha! ha!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You had better go away by the back stairs,&rsquo; said Trussell, stopping them;
      &lsquo;for there are a couple of officers in the hall waiting to arrest you!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Curse on it! I sent them myself!&rsquo; said Mr. Rathbone, &lsquo;to compel the
      rascal I supposed to be Mr. Wiliars to pay your debts.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And hurrying out of the room, he acted upon Trussell&rsquo;s suggestion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And now, rascal,&rsquo; said the beau to the valet, &lsquo;you are no longer in my
      service&mdash;I discharge you. And you may thank your stars that I let you
      off so easily.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I was about to discharge <i>you</i>. sir,&rsquo; rejoined the valet,
      impertinently. &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t desire to live with a gentleman who takes his
      servants by surprise. He&rsquo;s as bad as a jealous husband.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stay!&rsquo; cried the beau&mdash;&lsquo;you don&rsquo;t leave me in that way. Antoine,
      stand by him. Now, sir, take off that peruke&mdash;take it off carefully&mdash;now
      the sword.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The orders were obeyed, and the wig and sword delivered to the French
      valet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now take off the coat.&rsquo; Mr. Cripps complied with a sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now the waistcoat.&rsquo; The order was obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now the cravat.&rsquo; And it was taken off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now the diamond buckles.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anything else?&rsquo; inquired Mr. Cripps, as he gave up the buckles.
      &lsquo;Recollect there are ladies in the room, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes; take yourself off,&rsquo; rejoined the beau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even thus shorn of his splendour, Mr. Cripps maintained his customary
      assurance. He bowed profoundly and gracefully round, and quitted the room
      amid the laughter of the company.

      <span class="head">ABEL BEECHCROFT DISCOVERING THE MISER IN THE CELLAR&mdash;DEATH
      OF THE MISER</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o sooner, however,
      was one source of dread removed, than another was aroused. His hoards
      might be gone! Terrified by this idea, he flew to all his hiding-places,
      and placed their contents on the table. His dim eyes sparkled with
      unnatural brilliancy as he gloated over them.
    </p>
    <p>
      While telling over the pieces, and weighing them in his hand, a new
      recollection crossed him. Snatching up the candle, he hurried to a small
      cupboard at one side of the room, at the bottom of which lay a heap of old
      rags and rubbish, apparently put there out of the way. Hastily removing
      this dusty pile, some half dozen leathern bags were exposed to view.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here they are&mdash;here they are!&rsquo; he exclaimed, with a cry of childish
      delight. &lsquo;Oh, my darlings!&mdash;my treasures!&mdash;-how glad I am to see
      you. You give me new life. Talk of physic&mdash;pshaw! there is none like
      gold. The sight of it cures me in an instant. I feel well&mdash;quite
      well; no, not quite,&rsquo; he added, as a sudden giddiness seized him, and he
      had to catch at the closet door for support; &lsquo;not quite well; but better&mdash;much
      better. What a memory mine must be to forget these bags&mdash;each
      containing two hundred guineas&mdash;that&rsquo;s twelve hundred! Twelve hundred
      guineas! and I had forgotten them. I hope I have not forgotten anything
      else. Let me see&mdash;oh! my head!&mdash;my head!&rsquo; he continued, shaking
      it mournfully. &lsquo;My memory&rsquo;s clean gone!&mdash;clean gone! But what shall I
      do with these bags? they&rsquo;re not safe here. Jacob may find them in clearing
      the room. I&rsquo;ll hide them in the cellar with the other treasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Utterly forgetful that the chest had been removed, he immediately set
      about executing his design.
    </p>
    <p>
      Listening at the door to hear that all was still, he took up two of the
      bags with the intention of carrying them downstairs; but finding them too
      heavy for him, he was obliged to content himself with one, and thus in
      transporting them all to the cellar, he had to perform six journeys. The
      last had nearly proved fatal, for as he tottered down the cellar steps, he
      missed his footing, and rolled to the bottom.
    </p>
    <p>
      With some difficulty he got up again; but heedless of the bruises he had
      received, he picked up his candle, which was extinguished in the fall, and
      returned to his bedchamber to light it at the fire. This done, he procured
      the shovel, and repairing to the cellar commenced his task.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his present state of debility and exhaustion, it cost him infinite
      labour to get up the bricks, and he was frequently obliged to desist from
      the toil and rest himself; but though he shook in every limb&mdash;though
      thick damps burst from every pore, he still persevered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having got out the bricks, he carefully scraped off the surface of the
      loose sandy soil. Surprised that the spade met with no resistance, his
      alarm was instantly excited, and he plunged it deeply into the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      But no chest was there!
    </p>
    <p>
      For a few minutes he stood transfixed with despair. It never occurred to
      him that he had himself removed his treasure, but he concluded he had been
      robbed of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length his anguish found vent in a piercing cry, and he rushed towards
      the door with the intention of calling up Jacob; but the recollection that
      forced itself upon him, that the porter was from home, checked him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other imperfect ideas thronged upon his bewildered brain. A glimmering
      recollection of digging up the chest crossed him, but he fancied he must
      have taken out its contents and buried them deeper in the ground. Somewhat
      calmed by the idea, he commenced digging anew with frightful ardour, and
      soon cleared out the soil to nearly the depth of three feet. But as he
      found nothing, his apprehensions returned with new force and paralysed his
      efforts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Throwing aside the spade, he groped about in the sandy soil with his
      hands, in the hopes of finding a few pieces of gold. A single piece would
      have satisfied him; but there was none&mdash;nothing but little pebbles
      mixed with the sand. His moans, while thus employed, were truly piteous.
    </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture, his candle, which had long been expiring in the socket,
      went out, leaving him in total darkness. A mortal faintness seized him at
      the same time. He tried to get out of the hole, but fell back with the
      effort&mdash;his head striking against the bricks. He struggled to get up
      again, but in vain&mdash;his limbs refused their office. He tried to cry
      out for help, but a hollow rattling sound alone issued from his throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, by a convulsive effort, he did contrive to lift his head from
      the ground; but that was all he could do. His hands clutched ineffectually
      at the sandy soil; his frame was powerless; and a stifled groan broke from
      his lips. But this condition was too horrible for long endurance. The
      muscles of the neck relaxed; his head fell heavily backwards; and after a
      gasp or two, respiration ceased.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus died this unhappy man, unattended, in a cellar, half entombed in the
      hole digged as a hiding-place for a portion of his wealth&mdash;wealth for
      which he had sacrificed all his comforts, all his feelings, all his
      affections, and for which alone of late he had seemed to live. Thus he
      perished&mdash;a fearful example of the effects of the heart-searing vice
      of which he was the slave and the victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      After some little consideration, Abel went up alone to the miser&rsquo;s room,
      and knocking two or three times, and receiving no answer, opened the door.
      Approaching the bed, he found it empty, with the clothes turned down, as
      left by the miser; and casting a hurried glance into the closet to satisfy
      himself that no person was there, he hastily ran downstairs to Hilda, to
      acquaint her with the alarming discovery he had made.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was greatly terrified; but after a moment&rsquo;s reflection, suggested that
      her father might possibly have gone down to the cellar, and related the
      circumstance which she herself had once witnessed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Concurring in the opinion, Abel offered immediately to go in search of
      him; and dissuading Hilda, who secretly shared his worst apprehensions,
      from accompanying him, took a candle and descended to the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he entered the vault, he indistinctly perceived a ghastly object; and
      springing forward, held up the light, so as to reveal it more fully. His
      fancy had not deceived him. There, in a grave&mdash;evidently digged by
      his own hands&mdash;lay his old enemy&mdash;dead&mdash;dead!
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0017" id="linkimage-0017"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      While Abel was wrapt in contemplation of this miserable spectacle, and
      surrendering himself to the thoughts which it inspired, heavy steps were
      heard behind him, and Jacob rushed into the cellar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where is he?&rsquo; cried the porter, in accents of alarm. &lsquo;Has anything
      happened? Ha! I see.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And pushing past Abel Beechcroft, he precipitated himself into the hole
      with his master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All&rsquo;s over with him,&rsquo; he cried, in a voice of agony and self-reproach,
      and grasping the cold hand of the corpse. &lsquo;This would never have happened
      if I had been at home. I&rsquo;m in a manner his murderer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Another hand than yours has been at work here, Jacob,&rsquo; said Abel; &lsquo;and
      terrible as your poor master&rsquo;s fate has been, it may prove a salutary
      lesson to others. There he lies, who a few hours ago was the possessor of
      useless thousands, the value of which he knew not&mdash;nay, the very
      existence of which he knew not&mdash;for the few bags of gold beside him
      were the only palpable treasure he owned.

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> glance satisfied
      Firebras that all was right, and he returned slowly to the house, the
      landlord stamping upon the floor as he quitted the building, as a signal
      to the grenadiers that they might now come forth from their concealment.
      On reaching the house, Firebras dismissed the landlord, and going up to
      Randulph, clapped him on the shoulder, and said, &lsquo;I have rare news for
      you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I have rare news for you,&rsquo; replied the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hear mine first!&rsquo; cried Firebras. &lsquo;What if I tell you I am come to offer
      you your estates and the hand of Hilda, if you join the Jacobite party?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There would be no use in joining you now!&rsquo; returned Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You think I&rsquo;m trifling with you!&rsquo; cried Firebras, producing a packet;
      &lsquo;but this will speak to the contrary. Here is the assignment of your
      estates to Isaac Isaacs. A receipt in full of all claims is attached to
      it. The deed is yours, provided you join us.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You amaze me,&rsquo; cried Randulph, gazing at the packet; &lsquo;that is
      unquestionably the deed I executed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Most certainly it is,&rsquo; replied Firebras. &lsquo;It is too long a story to tell
      you how I became possessed of it,&rsquo; he added, replacing it in his pocket,
      &lsquo;but I have other intelligence for you. Mr. Scarve is dead!&rsquo; Randolph
      uttered an exclamation of surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He died last night,&rsquo; pursued Firebras, &lsquo;and left his property to Philip
      Frewin, in case of Hilda&rsquo;s refusal to marry him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But Philip may not live to claim the fulfilment of the condition,&rsquo; cried
      Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Philip, also, is dead,&rsquo; replied Firebras. And smiling at Randulph&rsquo;s
      astonishment, he added, &lsquo;Now you see that all is in your grasp. Fate has
      given you the lady of your love. I offer you your fortune. Can you refuse
      to join us?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Firebras,&rsquo; said Randulph, composing himself, &lsquo;this is not the time to
      put such a question to me.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pardon me,&rsquo; cried Firebras sternly, &lsquo;I must have an answer now&mdash;at
      this moment&mdash;or you lose your estates and Hilda for ever. Do not
      suppose I threaten lightly. I can, and will, make good my words.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You mistake me altogether,&rsquo; rejoined Randulph. &lsquo;I mean to say it would be
      useless for me to assent. You are betrayed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Betrayed!&rsquo; exclaimed Firebras, in a voice of thunder. &lsquo;How! by whom? But
      this is a mere assertion made to turn me from my purpose.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will find it too true,&rsquo; replied Randulph. &lsquo;The house is environed on
      all sides by grenadiers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have just visited the summer-house,&rsquo; said Firebras. &lsquo;There was no one
      there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The men were concealed in a lower chamber,&rsquo; said Randulph.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo; may be so,&rsquo; cried Firebras, with a terrible imprecation. &lsquo;But they
      shall not take me easily. My pistols! ha! they have been removed! The
      landlord, then, is our betrayer.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He is,&rsquo; replied Randulph. &lsquo;Your only chance of escape is apparent
      unconsciousness of the design. You might perhaps make good your own
      retreat&mdash;but the others&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will never desert them,&rsquo; said Firebras. &lsquo;There is a boat at hand, for I
      ordered Jacob Post to be in waiting for you off the summer-house, for
      another purpose, and I caught a glimpse of him just now. Ha! here come our
      friends.&rsquo; And, as he spoke, Sir Norfolk Salusbury, Sir Bulkeley Price,
      Father Verselyn, Mr. Travers, and four or five other gentlemen entered the
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave us, landlord,&rsquo; said Firebras; &lsquo;we will call you when we want you.&rsquo; 
      And the order being obeyed, he bolted the door. &lsquo;We are betrayed,
      gentlemen,&rsquo; said Firebras, in a low tone; &lsquo;the house is surrounded by
      guards, and our retreat is cut off by the river.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the words were uttered, the door was tried by some persons without,
      who, finding it fastened, proceeded to burst it open. &lsquo;To the garden! to
      the garden!&rsquo; cried Firebras. And the party made for the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before, however, the whole of them could pass through it, the officer and
      a party of grenadiers burst open the door, and endeavoured to seize them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Firebras and the others, with the exception of Randulph, drew off.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">DEATH OF TUE JACOBITE CLUB, AND OF CARDWELL FIREBRAS&mdash;DISPERSION</span>

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he Miser&rsquo;s
      Daughter their swords, and the next instant an encounter took place. But,
      as all was buried in darkness, little mischief was done. In spite of the
      efforts of the soldiers to prevent them, five or six of the Jacobites
      contrived to get across the ditch, and gaining the mill, took shelter
      within it. They were followed by a party of grenadiers, who fired a few
      shots at them. Whether the circumstance was the result of accident or
      design is immaterial, but a few minutes afterwards the mill was found to
      be on fire. Flames burst from the upper windows, throwing a fierce glare
      on the groups below, and brightly illumining the towers of Westminster
      Abbey.
    </p>
    <p>
      Repeated loud explosions were next heard, threatening each moment to shake
      the mill to pieces; while some of the unfortunate Jacobites were seen
      springing from a side window upon the waterwheel, and trying to descend by
      it. Two others, at the risk of breaking their necks, dropped from a window
      facing the river, and endeavoured to gain the vessel moored beside it. The
      fugitives on the water-wheel were held in check by a party of grenadiers,
      who, having thrown a couple of planks over the little stream, were enabled
      to reach them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, favoured by the previous darkness, for all was now as bright as
      day, Firebras, Salusbury, and the rest of the Jacobites made good their
      retreat as far as the summer-house. Some of them even managed to force
      their way to the platform. Here a desperate struggle took place, in which
      Sir Norfolk was severely wounded in the side by a bayonet. By this time
      the fire had broken out in the mill, and its glare showed Jacob at a
      little distance in a skiff. Notwithstanding the menaces of the soldiers,
      who pointed their guns at him, and threatened to fire if he approached
      nearer, Jacob pushed resolutely towards the summer-house.

      He was now close under the platform, and made signs to Randulph to
      descend, but the latter would not desert Sir Norfolk, who had been seized
      by a couple of grenadiers. He threw himself upon the old baronet&rsquo;s
      captors, and in the struggle that ensued, the railing gave way,
      precipitating Sir Bulkeley Price, the Jesuit, and the grenadiers into the
      tide. Before the other soldiers had recovered from their surprise at this
      occurrence, Randulph had lowered Sir Norfolk into the skiff and sprung in
      after him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jacob&rsquo;s efforts to push off were impeded by Sir Bulkeley Price, who clung
      to the stern of the skiff, earnestly imploring them to take him in. Father
      Verselyn caught hold of the steps, and apprehensive of some further
      disaster, crept along the side of the summer-house, and took refuge in a
      small sewer, in the slime of which it is supposed he perished, for he was
      never heard of more.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, Cardwell Firebras&mdash;engaged hand to hand with the officer,
      who, having vainly summoned him to surrender, attacked him in person&mdash;had
      reached the platform. Seeing escape impossible, Firebras, while defending
      himself against the officer, called to Randulph, whom he descried below,
      and held out the packet to him. The latter ordered Jacob to keep the skiff
      steady, and to bring it as near the combatants as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Jacob obeyed the injunction, a successful thrust from Firebras
      stretched his adversary upon the platform, but the next moment he received
      his own death-wound from Long Tom, who stepped forward as his officer
      fell, and discharged his musket into his breast. With a dying effort,
      Firebras stretched his hand over the rail, and consigning the packet to
      Randulph, fell backwards into the water. Possessed of the packet, Randulph
      turned to the aid of Sir Bulkeley Price, and pulling him into the skiff,
      Jacob instantly pushed off. Assisted by the stream, which ran very strong,
      they soon got under the sides of the vessel near the mill, and were
      sheltered from the fire of the soldiery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the conflagration raged fast and furiously, and before the
      skiff containing the fugitives had got half way to Westminster Bridge, a
      tremendous explosion took place, scattering the blazing fragments of the

      hurried it over, and proceed at once to the wished-for day.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little before nine o&rsquo;clock, on this eventful morning, Randulph, who had
      taken up his quarters with Sir Bulkeley Price, in Saint James&rsquo;s Square,
      entered the breakfast-room, arrayed in his bridal attire, which had been
      prepared for him by the skilful hands of Desmartins. He found Sir Bulkeley
      Price and Sir Norfolk Salusbury at the table&mdash;the latter having come
      up from Wales, whither he had retired to recruit himself after his wound,
      expressly to attend the ceremony. After receiving their congratulations,
      Randulph sat down with them, but as he could only swallow a cup of
      chocolate, he underwent much rallying on his want of appetite.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breakfast over, the party drove to Whitehall Stairs, where a six-oared
      barge was in readiness to convey them across the river. Jacob Post was
      appointed coxswain of this barge, and he wore a waterman&rsquo;s coat of scarlet
      cloth, and velvet jockey-shaped cap of the same colour. The six rowers
      were attired in the same livery, and presented a very gay appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning was bright and beautiful, and everything seemed to Randulph to
      participate in his happiness. Each boat that passed them, seeing the
      purpose on which they were bent, cheered them cordially, and Jacob, who
      was greatly elated, returned their greetings lustily.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they passed through Westminster Bridge, and shaped their rapid course
      to Lambeth, they passed a boat containing a couple in bridal attire, and
      rowed by watermen with favours in their caps. These were Mr. Rathbone and
      Mrs. Nettleship, who, having made a composition with their creditors, had
      come to the conclusion that the best thing they could do would be to
      fulfil their original agreement, and having heard that Randulph and Hilda
      were to be united at Lambeth, they determined, like Peter Pokerich and the
      fair Thomasine, to be married at the same time, and at the same church.
      The boats cheered each other as they passed. Shortly after this, they came
      up with a four-oared cutter, in which was a still more gaily dressed
      bridal party, consisting of Mr. and Mrs. Deacle, the fair Thomasine, and
      Peter Pokerich. The sunny tresses, bright eyes, and dimpling cheeks of the
      bride attracted Sir Bulkeley&rsquo;s admiration, and he called out to Peter that
      he ought to consider himself a very happy man; to which the little barber
      replied, &lsquo;that he was the happiest man in the world&mdash;Mr. Crew
      excepted.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another cheering passed between the rowers; and Randulph&rsquo;s barge swept
      over the sparkling waters to the stairs near Lambeth Palace, where he and
      his companions disembarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Abel Beechcroft was extremely well known and highly respected in the
      neighbourhood, great preparations were made to lend éclat to his nephew&rsquo;s
      wedding. A band of music was stationed on a lighter moored near the
      stairs; and the lighter itself was hung all over with flags and streamers.
      The band was playing, the bells ringing, and as Randulph leaped ashore, a
      loud shout from the crowd collected to see him land, welcomed him, while
      many flattering comments, in no very low key, were made upon his handsome
      appearance by the female part of the assemblage. In passing towards his
      uncle&rsquo;s residence, Randulph noticed with interest a troop of pretty little
      girls with wreaths round their heads, and baskets of flowers in their
      hands, standing in the path leading to the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The party were admitted by Mr. Jukes, whose portly figure was well
      displayed in an expansive snowy waistcoat, a brown coat, spick and span
      new for the occasion, and a well-powdered bob-wig. The worthy butler gave
      Randulph a hearty welcome, and wished him many years of happiness, and
      having ushered him and the others into the parlour, returned to the hall
      to Jacob, to give him wedding favours for himself and the watermen, which
      the other hastened to distribute.

    </h5>
    <p>
      The meeting between the young bride and bridegroom was full of agitated
      delight. Abel looked perfectly happy, but thoughtful, as did Mrs. Crew,
      whose emotion found relief in an occasional sigh&mdash;not the sigh of
      misgiving, but the relief of a joy-oppressed heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trussell was, as usual, in very high spirits. He shook Randulph heartily
      by the hand, wished him all sorts of happiness, and then cordially greeted
      the Welsh baronets. Besides Mrs. Clinton, there was another young lady
      present, the daughter of an old friend of Mrs. Crew&rsquo;s, a Miss Wilbraham,
      who acted as bridesmaid to Hilda.
    </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards, all being in readiness, the bride prepared to set forth
      under the care of Abel Beechcroft, who, before they quitted the house, in
      an earnest tone, invoked a blessing on her head and on that of his nephew.
      And both felt that the blessing of so good a man would not be thrown away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cheered by the good wishes and smiling countenances of the groups through
      which they had passed, and enlivened by the sunshine, the party entered
      the church. Peter Pokerich and the fair Thomasine, with Mr. Rathbone and
      Mrs. Nettleship, were already standing beside the altar. The young couple
      advanced, and took the central place, and the church was instantly crowded
      with spectators. The service was admirably performed by a venerable
      clergyman&mdash;an old and valued friend of Abel&rsquo;s, and at its close, the
      concourse issued from the church, dividing into two lines, so as to allow
      a passage for the wedding train.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the happy couple were seen issuing hand-in-hand from the Gothic
      portal of the old church, a loud and joyous shout was raised by the
      assemblage, a couple of guns were fired on board the lighter, and the
      church bells rang forth a joyous peal.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a heart-cheering sight, and many a breast throbbed, and many an eye
      grew moist at beholding it. And plenty of spectators there were. The whole
      of the area before the church was filled, and the windows and towers of
      the old archiépiscopal palace were studded with faces. The little
      flower-girls now stepped forward, and strewed their fragrant offerings in
      the path of the happy pair, who walked on amid the continued cheers of the
      bystanders.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little behind Randulph, on the right, walked Trussell, who, excited by
      the general enthusiasm, had placed his hat on his cane, and waved it to
      the crowd. Near him came Abel and Miss Wilbraham, the former with a
      glowing smile on his countenance, such as Mr. Jukes himself never
      remembered to have witnessed. After them walked Sir Norfolk Salusbury and
      Mrs. Crew. Next in order came Mr. and Mrs. Pokerich, the latter of whom
      thought it decorous to turn aside her pretty face from the ardent gaze of
      her enamoured little lord. Lastly came Mr. and Mrs. Rathbone, whose
      appearance did not seem greatly to interest the spectators. Sir Bulkeley
      Price had posted himself on the left of the church door, to watch the
      wedding train pass by, and to wait the coming forth of the clergyman.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Randulph advanced through the crowd, Jacob Post stepped forward, and
      holding out his rough, honest hand to him, said in a voice, the sincerity
      of which could not be doubted, &lsquo;God bless you, sir, and your lovely bride,
      and may you know years of uninterrupted happiness!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And take my blessing too,&rsquo; said Mr. Jukes, likewise extending his hand.
      &lsquo;An old man&rsquo;s good wishes, though he be but a dependant, can do no harm.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I thank you both!&rsquo; cried Randulph, in a voice of emotion; &lsquo;and my wife
      thanks you too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do&mdash;I do,&rsquo; she replied; &lsquo;nor do I doubt the fulfilment of your
      wishes.&rsquo; And as she uttered these words, loud and deafening cheers rent
      the air, and another discharge of guns took place.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this way they proceeded to the house, where they were followed by the
      rest of the party, and presently afterwards by the clergyman and Sir
      Bulkeley. They then all sat down to an excellent repast.
    </p>
    <p>
      By desire of his hospitable master, Mr. Jukes invited the other couples
      and their friends to take refreshments at his house, which, as they
      delightedly availed themselves of the offer, were served to them in the
      summer-house overlooking the river; where, while enjoying themselves, they
      did not forget to drink long life and happiness to Randulph and his bride.
    </p>
    <p>
      The honeymoon&mdash;all the rest of their life was a honeymoon&mdash;was
      passed by the happy couple, in good old-fashioned style, at Lambeth. They
      then proceeded to Cheshire, accompanied by Trussell and Mrs. Crew, and
      were soon afterwards followed by Abel, who passed the winter with them. In
      due time the prognostications of Mr. Jukes were fulfilled, and Abel
      displayed no objection to the endearments of two great-nieces and a
      great-nephew.
    </p>
    <p>
      Appointed Randulph&rsquo;s head-gamekeeper, Jacob Post passed the remainder of
      his days in the service of his new master. Of the two brothers Beechcroft,
      Abel was the first to pay the debt of nature, Trussell survived him two or
      three years, during which he was a great martyr to gout. He never,
      however, lost his temper, except when young Master Randulph accidentally
      trod on his toe, and then he would swear a round oath, to frighten him,
      and try to hit at him with his stick, as testy old gentlemen are wont to
      do in plays. Randulph and Hilda almost touched the verge of the nineteenth
      century; and from the anecdotes of one of their descendants, in the third
      generation, the materials of the present tale have been collected.

      <span class="head">THE CRADLE OF THE REBELLION</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he rebellious
      movement which, in 1798, openly burst into the horrors of civil war, had
      for years been maturing. The success of the American colonists in
      defeating the mother country, and the upheaval in France, the great
      Revolution, proved fatal precedents, and the easily excited minds of the
      Irish people led the disloyal and disaffected of the sister kingdom to
      contemplate the forcible carrying out of a similar policy. As will be
      seen, this fratricidal struggle largely resolved itself into a religious
      campaign between the Catholic and Protestant sections of the community.
    </p>
    <p>
      At an early stage of the coming struggle the ulterior objects of the
      discontented Catholics became perfectly apparent, and some of their
      warmest advocates took alarm. Sir Hercules Langrish, in his place in the
      Irish Parliament, thus addressed the House: &lsquo;Notwithstanding my
      prepossessions in favour of the Roman Catholics, I was checked for some
      time in my ardour to serve them, by reading of late a multitude of
      publications and paragraphs in the newspapers, and other public prints,
      circulated <i>gratis</i> with the utmost industry, purporting to convey
      the sentiments of the Catholics. What was their import? They were
      exhortations to the people never to be satisfied at any concession till
      the State itself was conceded: they were precautions against public
      tranquillity; they were invitations to disorder, and covenants of
      discontent; they were ostentations of strength, rather than solicitations
      for favour; rather appeals to the power of the people, than applications
      to the authority of the State; they involved the relief of the Catholic,
      with the revolution of the Government; and were dissertations for
      democracy, rather than arguments for toleration.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">APPEAL TO FORCE OF ARMS</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      Acting, however, on the resolutions they had published, the Committees
      determined to summon a Convention in imitation of the proceedings which
      were at the time violently revolutionising France, where the horrors of
      the great French Rebellion had already unsettled everything in 1789.
      Circulars were issued by their leaders&mdash;representatives elected in
      the counties&mdash;and on the 3rd of December 1792 the &lsquo;Back Lane
      Parliament&rsquo; commenced its first session in Tailor&rsquo;s Hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The daring measure of calling together an assembly, where the delegates
      debated with closed doors, was followed by a still bolder demonstration.
      The discontented Romanists resolved upon making an overbearing display of
      physical force, and declared their intention to arm, to maintain their
      rights and effect their objects. For this purpose large sums of money were
      levied, and a body was enrolled in the metropolis under the title of &lsquo;The
      National Guard.&rsquo; They were arrayed in green uniforms, with a harp without
      the crown displayed upon the buttons and appointments. Orders were issued
      for a general muster on the 9th of December; but a proclamation, issued by
      the Lord Lieutenant, declared the body to be dangerous to the public
      peace, and directed the authorities to disperse the meeting should it be
      attempted, and employ force were it required. Many conjectures were
      hazarded at the time respecting the objects of the movement; some asserted
      that it was merely intended, by an exhibition of numerical strength, to
      confirm unsteady friends, and intimidate those who were opposed to them;
      others, however, ascribed to the National Guards more serious and
      sanguinary designs&mdash;&lsquo;to seize even then upon the city, and commence
      at once a civil war.&rsquo; Certain it is that the Government were led to
      apprehend that this muster would lead to a revolutionary movement, and,
      accordingly, the most decisive measures were taken to render it abortive.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head"> &lsquo;THE UNITED IRISHMEN&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o follow up the
      progress and proceedings of the &lsquo;United Irishmen&rsquo; throughout that unquiet
      period which intervened between the lieutenancies of Earls Westmoreland
      and Camden would be unnecessary. Their civil and military organisation,
      however, shall be described, and a brief analysis given of their general
      history from the epoch where we have broken off, when the seeds of
      disaffection had taken a firm root, and a conspiracy was hatched, which, a
      few years afterwards, became fatally matured, and exploded in 1798 with
      portentous violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the colour of volunteering, the arming and drilling of the
      malcontents continued. A proclamation, issued by the 11th of March 1793,
      declared these proceedings illegal, and attached penal consequences to any
      who should continue them. The preamble ran thus: &lsquo;Whereas certain
      seditious and ill-affected persons, in several parts of the north,
      particularly in the town of Belfast, have endeavoured to foment and
      encourage discontent, and to defame the Government and the Parliament, by
      seditious publications circulated among the people; and that several
      bodies of men have been collected in armed associations, and have been
      levied and arrayed in the said town of Belfast; and that arms and
      gunpowder to a very large amount have been sent thither; and that bodies
      of men have been drilled and exercised by day and night, under the pretext
      of obtaining a redress of grievances, though the obvious intention appears
      to be to overawe the Parliament and the Government, and to dictate to
      both.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This and the Gunpowder Act struck heavily at the military organisations of
      the revolutionists; while the Convention Act, subsequently passed,
      embarrassed the leaders of the movement so much, that an influential
      member of the Union, Samuel Neilson, afterwards declared, &lsquo;That the bill
      was calculated to meet every part of the system, and the framer must have
      had their constitution in his hand when he was devising its provisions.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">&lsquo;THE DEFENDERS&rsquo; AND &lsquo;ORANGE LODGES&rsquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n 1794 and 1795
      outrages by &lsquo;the Defenders&rsquo;&mdash;a lawless confederacy, exclusively
      Catholic&mdash;became general, and the Protestants associated for
      self-defence. A conflict between the rival religionists took place at a
      spot called &lsquo;The Diamond,&rsquo; in the county of Armagh, in which the Defenders
      were signally defeated. In commemoration of this success the first Orange
      Lodge was formed on the 21st of September 1795. The system of Orange
      Lodges &lsquo;was not established in the metropolis, though many years
      threatened with open rebellion, till the month of January 1798; and many
      gentlemen of high character and considerable talents placed themselves at
      its head, to give the institution a proper direction, and to silence the
      calumnious clamours of traitors against it.&rsquo; The &lsquo;Orange&rsquo; organisation,
      slowly but steadily, gained strength, until the body was considered in the
      north of Ireland so numerous and effective, that General Knox, commanding
      at the outbreak in 1798, assured the Government that to these ardent
      supporters of the constitution the safety of Ulster might be confidently
      entrusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">STATE PROSECUTIONS</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>arly in the annals
      of the movement several of the revolutionary leaders were subjected to
      State prosecutions for sedition. Hamilton Rowan was convicted, fined, and
      imprisoned, but escaped in women&rsquo;s clothes from Newgate; Nappy Tandy
      placed under bail, but fled the kingdom to avoid a trial; Doctor Drennan
      was tried and acquitted; Tone expatriated himself, and went with his
      family to America; but Jackson, an English clergyman, and an envoy from
      the French Republican Government to the Irish revolutionists, was, on the
      23rd of April 1795, capitally convicted of high treason. The unhappy man
      committed suicide, and poisoned himself in the prisoner&rsquo;s bar, immediately
      after the foreman had announced him guilty.
    </p>
    <p>
      The recall of Lord Westmoreland and the appointment of Lord Fitzwilliam as
      viceroy raised the sinking confidence of the Catholic party as much as it
      depressed the hopes of the Orangists. The well-known bias of the Earl&rsquo;s
      political opinions was warmly in favour of fresh and full concessions, and
      it was supposed that Catholic emancipation was at hand. While the Roman
      Catholics were buoyant with high expectation, arising from the noble
      lord&rsquo;s appointment to the Irish lieutenancy, a sudden recall crushed their
      hopes and augmented their disaffection. From this period their hostility
      to any monarchical form of government appears to have become inveterate,
      and the first test required of a United Irishman&mdash;one in which a
      reformed Parliament was distinctly recognised&mdash;was instantly
      exchanged for another purely democratical.

      <span class="head">OATH OF THE &lsquo;UNITED IRISHMEN&rsquo;</span>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he initiatory oath
      taken henceforth by the United Irishmen was thus worded:&mdash;&lsquo;In the
      awful presence of God, I,... do voluntarily declare that I will persevere
      in endeavouring to form a brotherhood of affection among Irishmen of <i>every</i>
      religious persuasion, and that I will also persevere in my endeavours to
      obtain an equal, full, and adequate representation of <i>all</i> the
      people of Ireland. I do further declare, that neither hopes, fears,
      rewards, or punishments, shall ever induce me, directly or indirectly, to
      inform or give evidence against any member or members of this or similar
      societies, for any act or expression of theirs, done or made collectively
      or individually in and out of this society, in pursuance of the spirit of
      this obligation.&rsquo;

    <p>
      <span class="head">FRENCH INVASION INVITED</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      1796 was not fated to enjoy more tranquillity than the stormy era that
      preceded it. A compulsory increase of military power, under the provisions
      of the Militia Bill, increased the general discontent, and the public
      uneasiness was not abated by a discovery that the French Directory had
      undertaken to land an invading army to assist the Irish revolutionists,
      who, on their part, undertook to pay these auxiliaries, and eventually
      defray the whole expenses of the expedition. Additional powers were now
      demanded by the Irish Executive, and the Insurrection Act, which had
      passed in spring, was followed up by a suspension of <i>habeas corpus</i>
      in October.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt that these stringent powers were afterwards sadly and
      frequently abused. Arrests on secret information&mdash;districts
      unnecessarily proclaimed&mdash;suspected persons sent, without the shadow
      of a trial, on board the fleet&mdash;military license&mdash;arbitrary
      impressment of beasts of burden for baggage transport&mdash;abuse in
      billeting&mdash;a general insolence in the soldiery,&mdash;all these
      formed constant subject for complaint, and, unfortunately, it was seldom
      made without ample provocation.
    </p>
    <p>
      These severities were impolitic&mdash;they reacted against the Government&mdash;and
      the feelings of the lower orders became exasperated, but not subdued. The
      most deeply marked of innate feelings in the human breast is resistance to
      oppression, whether it be real or imaginary. The peasantry assembled by
      night to drill, or deprive the loyalists of their arms, whilst by day they
      collected in enormous numbers to harvest the crops of persons imprisoned
      for political offences, or under the pretext of attending a funeral, or a
      hurling match, they paraded in military array, with banners and martial
      music.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the disaffected thus evinced warm sympathy for their imprisoned
      friends, reaping their corn and securing their potato crops, they were
      equally assiduous in shielding them from the penal consequences of their
      crimes. Bribery and intimidation were the means commonly employed, and
      should these fail, assassination was not infrequent. This system of terror
      too frequently sheltered the guilty from the punishment they deserved;
      for, dreading the consequences of conviction and consequent reprisals,
      witnesses prevaricated, intimidated jurors were afraid to do their duty,
      and the criminal escaped.

      1797 General Lake issued a proclamation, directing that all persons
      unauthorised to keep arms should surrender them forthwith to the proper
      authorities. It was declared that secret information where weapons were
      concealed should be liberally rewarded, and the full value of such arms as
      might be thus recovered should be given to the informant. That the
      quantity hidden throughout the kingdom was immense may be conceived from
      the fact that, within the year, and in two provinces alone, Ulster and
      Leinster, 129,583 weapons of various descriptions were seized or
      surrendered. In this number there were 48,000 firelocks, 70,000 pikes, and
      22 pieces of cannon.

      At this period it is probable that the United Irishmen, in point of
      numbers and organisation, were almost as formidable as at the moment of
      the insurrection. In the northern provincial meetings particular inquiries
      were made of the delegates assembled, &lsquo;whether they considered themselves
      as being sufficiently strong to disarm the military quartered in their
      respective districts?&rsquo; and, with a few exceptions, the question received
      an affirmative reply. Although too successful in corrupting the soldiers,
      they appear to have made very erroneous calculations as to the number
      whose allegiance had been shaken. Many, both of the line and the militia,
      became pretended converts to republicanism merely to obtain the money and
      entertainment offered liberally by the disaffected. Some regiments,
      however, became seriously tainted with disloyalty; but, generally, the
      active measures to counteract seduction adopted by the commanding officers
      defeated the attempt.

      the leaders of the disaffected waited with impatience the assistance
      promised them through their agents by the French Directory.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military organisation of the United Irishmen was grafted on their
      elaborately framed civil representative constitution, and was constituted
      in the following manner:&mdash;&lsquo;The secretary of each subordinate society,
      composed of twelve members, was appointed their petty or non-commissioned
      officer. The delegate of five societies to a lower baronial committee was
      commonly appointed captain of a company, consisting of the five societies
      who had delegated him, and who made the number of sixty privates; and then
      the delegate of ten lower baronials to the upper or district committee was
      commonly appointed colonel of a battalion, which was thus composed of six
      hundred. The colonels of battalions in each county sent in the names of
      three persons to the Executive Directory of the Union, one of whom was
      appointed by them adjutant-general of the county, whose duty it was to
      receive and communicate military orders from the Executive to the colonels
      of battalions, and in general to act as officer of the revolutionary
      staff. They were required to inform themselves of, and report the state of
      the rebel regiments within their respective districts, of the number of
      mills, the roads, rivers, bridges, and fords, the military positions, the
      capacity of the towns and villages to receive troops, to communicate to
      the Executive every movement of the enemy (meaning the King&rsquo;s troops), to
      announce the first appearance of their allies (the French invaders), and
      immediately to collect their forces.

      was to prepare a plan for a general insurrection unsupported by foreign
      aid; the other, to devise the best means of co-operation with a French
      army, in the event of the promised descent being effected on the coast of
      Ireland. On this event the Directory calculated with such certainty in
      1797, that a general order &lsquo;to be ready&rsquo; was issued through the provincial
      committees. Those who had the means to obtain them were exhorted to
      procure firearms and ammunition&mdash;pikes were to be provided by the
      lower orders&mdash;and throughout three provinces the order was promptly
      obeyed. The organisation of Connaught was, fortunately, still imperfect,
      and at the outbreak of the insurrection the western counties were, happily
      for themselves, quite unprepared for action.

      December&mdash;the morning after the French admiral had issued orders to
      cut the cables and put to sea&mdash;Wolf Tone, who was the active spirit
      of the expedition, thus describes the situation to which the remnant of
      the invading forces was reduced:&mdash;&lsquo;The morning is now come, the gale
      continues, and the fog is so thick that we cannot see a ship&rsquo;s length
      ahead; so here we lie in the utmost uncertainty and anxiety. In all
      probability we are now left without admiral or general; if so, Cherin will
      command the troops, and Bedout the fleet; but, at all events, there is an
      end of the expedition. Certainly we have been persecuted by a strange
      fatality, from the very night of our departure to this hour. We have lost
      two commanders-in-chief; of four admirals not one remains; we have lost
      one ship of the line (the <i>Séduisant</i> was shipwrecked) that we know
      of, and probably many others of which we know nothing; we have been now
      six days in Bantry Bay, within 500 yards of the shore, without being able
      to effect a landing; we have been dispersed four times in four days; and
      at this moment, of 43 sail, of which the expedition consisted, we can
      muster of all sizes but 14. There only wants our falling in with the
      English to complete our destruction.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 27th the weather continued stormy. Several ships were obliged to
      cut and run, the fleet was reduced to 7 sail of the line and a frigate,
      the troops to 4200 men, and the artillery to two four-pounders. As a last
      effort this miserable remnant of the expedition determined to seek the
      Shannon, which had been named as the place of rendezvous. During the whole
      gale, which blew on the night of the 28th, a sixth separation occurred,
      and three seventy-fours and a frigate parted company. On the 29th the
      commodore signalised the other captains to steer for France, and the last
      ship of an expedition intended to overthrow the British monarchy quitted
      the shores of Ireland without having landed a single soldier, communicated
      with the disaffected, or thrown a musket on the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The failure of the first attempt at an invasion was a fatal disappointment
      to the Irish Unionists; and although hopes were held out that a second
      armament would be fitted out by the French Directory without delay, the
      financial and political embarrassments of the Republic gave little promise
      that it would or could be effected. Hoche, who did not reach France for
      fifteen days after Grouchy, was nominated soon after to the command of the
      army of the Sambre and the Meuse. This appointment was heavily regretted
      by the agents of the United Irishmen, for there is no doubt that Ireland
      was to Hoche the favourite field of ambition that Egypt was afterwards to
      Bonaparte; and undoubtedly he was sincere in his expressed intention of
      making the second effort at invasion, had not his sudden dissolution
      intervened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The affair,&rsquo; replied he, &lsquo;is but suspended. You know our difficulties for
      money; the repair of our fleet and the necessary preparations require some
      considerable time, and, in the meantime, there are 15,000 men lying idle
      below, and, in fact, we cannot even feed them there. The Directory has
      resolved, in the meantime, to employ them usefully elsewhere, and has
      accepted my services; but be assured, the moment the enterprise is
      resumed, that I will return with the first <i>patrouille</i> which
      embarks.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>General Hoche to Tone.</i> Hoche sank from rapid
      consumption, it is said, 19th of September 1797, in command of the united
      armies of the Rhine and Sambre and Meuse. Adverse fate seemed determined
      to overwhelm unhappy Ireland, but fortune again miraculously warded off
      the desperately threatening conjunction of affairs.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>rom another
      quarter, however, the Irish revolutionists obtained both sympathy and
      support. Lewines, the chief agent of the United Irishmen, had been
      accredited to Spain and Holland, with both powers England being at war, to
      request assistance. From the Spanish Government he received, generally, an
      encouraging answer to his memorial; and from the Batavian Executive a
      positive assurance of prompt and powerful co-operation on the part of the
      Dutch republicans&mdash;a promise they endeavoured to faithfully perform.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an awful epoch in British history; and it would have been difficult
      to say whether at home or abroad the political position of England was
      more embarrassed and portentous. Conquest had attended the onward march of
      the Republicans, and victory had succeeded victory; and while Ireland was
      ready to explode, public confidence was shaken to its centre, for that
      stay of Britain&mdash;her fleet&mdash;had failed her in her trying hour,
      and broken into open mutiny. Such was the ominous aspect, foreign and
      domestic, when the Batavian Government determined to strike a blow, that,
      if fortunately delivered, might have gone far to dismember that island
      empire which had wrung from the Dutch the dominion of the seas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Holland was a power to be dreaded. France threatened and intended a
      descent, but she possessed the wish, rather than the power to effect it.
      Her naval executive was wretchedly defective, her marine and monetary
      resources limited and precarious; and while the dockyard authorities
      declared that eight weeks would be sufficient to fit out a second
      expedition, it was probable&mdash;and so it proved&mdash;that as many
      months must elapse before a fleet could be sent afloat. With the Dutch
      Republic matters were in a different state. In the Texel five-and-twenty
      line-of-battle ships and frigates were lying manned, equipped, and ready
      for sea; 15,000 troops were ordered for instant embarkation; and with a
      quantity of spare arms, a large artillery force, and plenty of money to
      subsist the troops when landed, the Batavian armament undauntedly
      determined to push out of harbour with the first fair wind, elude Admiral
      Warren and his blockading squadron&mdash;if they could&mdash;or, if
      intercepted, stand an action with the British admiral&rsquo;s forces, and thus
      endeavour to redeem the honour of a flag that once had been feared and
      respected.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Dutch Government proved their sincerity of intention by the selection
      they made for the command of the expedition. The naval department was
      entrusted to De Winter, an officer of distinguished reputation, while the
      troops were placed under the direction of Daendels, a man justly
      considered to be the best general in the service of the Republic. The
      feelings of the Batavian Executive towards the Irish revolutionists were
      ardent and disinterested, and nothing could surpass the enthusiastic
      spirit which pervaded both the military and marine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tone relates in his <i>Memoirs</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;General Daendels showed me
      to-day his instructions from the Dutch Government. They are fair and
      honest, and I have no doubt he will act up to them. The spirit of them is,
      always to maintain the character of a faithful ally, and not to interfere
      in the domestic concerns of the people; to aid them, by every means in his
      power, to establish their liberty and independence, and to expect no
      condition in return, but that we should throw off the English yoke, and
      that, when all was settled on that score, we should arrange our future
      commerce with the Dutch Republic on the basis of reciprocal advantage and
      accommodation.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      But it would appear that against invasive efforts fortune had declared
      herself an enemy, and the same wind that prevented the landing of a French
      armament as obstinately resisted the sailing of the Dutch one. Day after
      day fifteen sail-of-the-line, eight frigates, and thirty transports lay at
      single anchor, locked up in the Texel, while a breeze, any point to
      northward, would have carried them to sea with eighteen battalions of
      infantry, four of chasseurs, eight squadrons of cavalry, and eleven
      companies of artillery&mdash;the whole forming an efficient and
      well-appointed army of 14,000 men, a force more than sufficient, under
      happy auspices, to have changed an empire&rsquo;s fate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Foul winds continued. The spirit of troops cooped up a month on shipboard
      gradually abated, and golden opportunities slipped away. Even the most
      sanguine began to doubt, a coolness arose between the commanders, and De
      Winter at last memorialised his Government, and intimated that the
      expedition, as far as its original destination was concerned, must be
      abandoned for the present. The document stated that July had been named
      for the attempt, that on the 9th all was ready, that the English fleet
      (the forces of which he rightly foresaw, would have to be faced) at that
      time consisted, at the very most, of thirteen sail-of-the-line, which
      could not make any effectual opposition, that contrary winds having
      prevailed ever since, without an hour&rsquo;s intermission, the enemy had had
      time to reinforce himself to the number of seventeen sail-of-the-line, so
      that he had now a superiority in force over the Dutch fleet, which, of
      course, rendered the issue of an engagement, to a certain degree,
      doubtful; that, by this unforeseen delay, which might, and probably would,
      continue still longer, a great additional consumption of provisions had
      taken place, so that in a very few days there would be barely sufficient
      for the voyage north-about; that the season was now rapidly passing away,
      and, if the foul wind continued a fortnight longer, the voyage would
      become highly dangerous, if not utterly impracticable, with a fleet
      encumbered with so many transports, and amounting to nearly seventy sail
      of all kinds, and that, in consequence, even a successful action with the
      English would not ensure the success of the enterprise, which the very
      season would negative; that for all these reasons, his opinion was that
      the present plan was no longer advisable, and in consequence he proposed
      that it should be industriously published that the expedition was given
      up; that the troops should be disembarked, except from 2500 to 3000 men of
      the <i>élite</i> of the army, who with twenty or thirty pieces of
      artillery, and all the arms and ammunition, should remain on board the
      frigates and one or two of the fastest-sailing transports; that as the
      vigilance of the enemy would probably be relaxed in consequence, this
      flotilla should profit by the first favourable moment to put to sea, and
      push for their original destination, where they should land the men, arms,
      and artillery, and he would charge himself with the execution of this
      plan; that by this means, even if they failed, the Republic would be at no
      very great loss, and if they succeeded must gain exceedingly; that she
      would preserve her grand fleet, which was now her last stake, and, during
      the winter, would be able to augment it, so as to open the next campaign&mdash;in
      case peace was not made <i>ad interim</i>&mdash;with twenty
      sail-of-the-line in the North Sea. These were most certainly very strong
      reasons, and, unfortunately for the would-be invaders, the wind gave them
      every hour fresh weight.

      De Winter&rsquo;s advice the troops were landed, and the Dutch attempt upon
      Ireland virtually abandoned; for although it was ordered that the invading
      army should be so cantoned that it could be instantly concentrated for
      embarkation, its future destination was changed, and the north of Scotland
      was declared a fitter place for the attempt than the Irish coast. But
      these designs were never carried out, for the excellent reason that the
      British North Sea fleet under Duncan&rsquo;s leadership was prepared to
      intervene. On the 11th October 1797 De Winter put to sea, and the
      memorable action of Camperdown resulted. Both fleets in numbers, men, and
      metal were much the same, and though the Dutch vessels were skilfully
      handled and most gallantly fought, their defeat was so decisive, that with
      this crushing blow the marine power of the States of Holland was finally
      extinguished.

      Batavian Government in giving their promised assistance to the Irish
      malcontents proved in many respects most injurious to the success of the
      conspiracy. The ardent expectations of succour from abroad, so long and
      eagerly expected, vanished with the crowning victory of Camperdown. This
      heavy and irremediable disaster abated the confidence of the most
      sanguine, distracted the deliberations of the leaders, and hurried the
      lower classes into overt acts of violence which irritated the royalists
      and provoked a fearful retaliation. Indeed, on both sides exasperated
      feelings had produced cruelty, and, as a consequence, barbarous reaction.
      The troops, with the impunity attendant upon martial law, made a plea of
      disaffection the excuse for licence and exaction; and upon the innocent
      and guilty, too frequently, the vengeance of the Executive was
      indiscriminately directed. The summary infliction of corporal and capital
      punishment&mdash;the destruction of property&mdash;the severity attached
      to charges of sedition, when secret enmity and vile espionage would bring
      ruin on the unoffending, and suspicion was held synonymous with guilt,&mdash;all
      these severities, equally illegal and injudicious, kindled a ferocity of
      feeling between parties which milder measures might have allayed,
      accustomed men to acts of violence from which otherwise they would have
      revolted, and reconciled them to the terrible barbarities attendant upon
      civil war.

      denied that cruelty in the authorities found much extenuation in the
      crimes committed by the disaffected. That accursed crime, so alien to
      British feeling, became every day more prevalent, and secret assassination
      was perpetrated by the ignorant, and encouraged by the most infamous
      prints which ever damned a cause. <i>The Union Star</i> headed its columns
      with a broad encouragement to murder, and individuals were regularly
      branded for the knife; <i>The Press</i> was equally violent, but its
      sedition was modified&mdash;the treasonable doctrines of the one being
      levelled generally against public securities, while a malignant hatred to
      the person inculcated in the leading article of the other the
      assassination of those who were obnoxious. Both these inflammatory prints
      were eventually prosecuted and put down; and while no publications ever
      called for the intervention of the law-officers more imperiously, in
      justice we must add that none were more unconstitutionally disposed of&mdash;a
      military mob demolished the one, the civil authorities arbitrarily
      suppressed the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the cause which they ardently but unwisely advocated these prints were
      fatally mischievous. There were two great parties in the kingdom: one&mdash;the
      Roman Catholics&mdash;had serious reasons for discontent, for statutory
      enactments excluded them from civil rights; with the Protestants it was
      different&mdash;they had much to reform, but nothing to obtain. In the
      north of Ireland and part of Leinster, as it does at present, the wealth,
      the moral character, and hence the moral influence of the kingdom, might
      be considered as being concentrated; and, as it will ever be, the
      intelligence of the minor section of the Irish people overbalanced the
      physical superiority of the other. To one object&mdash;wild and
      imaginative&mdash;the efforts of the Protestant party were directed; to
      another&mdash;vague, bigoted, and impracticable&mdash;the Romanists
      addressed themselves. Hence the combination of interests and feelings was
      easily disorganised, and within six months after an eternity of union had
      been announced as existing between religionists virulently opposed, the
      discrepancy of intentions had severed the Roman Catholics and Dissenters
      so completely, that the conviction exists, had the issue come to trial,
      nineteen out of twenty of the northern republicans would have eventually
      joined the royal banner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musgrave, in his <i>Memoirs</i>, has pointed out this logical conclusion:&mdash;&lsquo;When
      Dickey, a rebel leader and a Dissenter, was on the point of being hanged
      at Belfast, he declared that the eyes of Presbyterians had been opened too
      late; and that they were convinced by the massacres perpetrated by the
      Romanists in the province of Leinster, that they must have had to contend
      with them if they had succeeded in overturning the constitution.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret informer played a most important part in this fearsome history
      from its commencement; of these&mdash;the most important&mdash;because
      occupying the most influential position, was Mr. Thomas Reynolds, of the
      county of Kildare, who had acquired a landed property at Kilkea Castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Edward Fitzgerald and Oliver Bond, two leaders in the conspiracy,
      having, for the reason that he possessed considerable influence amongst
      the Romanists, considered Reynolds a proper person to assist in forwarding
      their treasonable designs, practised every art of seduction to attach him
      to their cause; and having at last succeeded, he was sworn a United
      Irishman at the house of Oliver Bond in Dublin in the beginning of the
      year 1797, was induced to accept the commission of colonel, the offices of
      treasurer and representative of the county of Kildare, and at last that of
      delegate for the province of Leinster.

      to abolish all religious distinctions, which was their professed object at
      first, meditated the subversion of the constitution, the massacre of the
      leading members of Government, and of such persons as should oppose their

      <span class="head">REVELATIONS OF THE SECRET TRAITOR-INFORMER</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>e had a very great
      friendship and respect for Mr. Cope, an eminent merchant of the city of
      Dublin, who, having lamented to him in the course of conversation the
      crimes and atrocities which were constantly committed, and which were
      undoubted symptoms of an approaching rebellion, Mr. Reynolds, upon whom
      his conversation had made a very deep impression, said, &lsquo;That he knew a
      person connected with the United Irishmen, who, he believed, would defeat
      their nefarious projects by communicating them to Government, in order to
      make an atonement for the crime he had committed in joining them.&rsquo; Mr.
      Cope assured him that such a person would obtain the highest honours and
      pecuniary rewards that the administration could confer, and that he would
      be admired and applauded by the most virtuous and valuable portion of
      society. But Mr. Reynolds said that nothing could tempt him to come
      forward and avow himself. However, after the most earnest and pressing
      solicitations repeatedly made on the part of Mr. Cope, for whom he had
      filial reverence, he said that his friend would appear in person and
      disclose the particulars of the plot on the following conditions:&mdash;&ldquo;That
      he should not be called upon in person to prosecute any United Irishmen;
      that the channel through which the information came should be kept a
      secret, at least for a time; that, as his life would be in danger upon its
      being known, and he must leave the country and go to England till matters
      were settled&mdash;which would derange his affairs, and put him to
      considerable expense&mdash;he expected to receive some compensation. Mr.
      Cope then told him that he might draw on him for any sum not exceeding
      five hundred guineas. On that he told Mr. Cope that the Leinster delegates
      were to meet at Oliver Bond&rsquo;s on the 12th of March to concert measures for
      an insurrection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It will be seen that, to pierce the conspiracy, no common informer was
      likely to penetrate the secrets of the confederacy. Save to a chosen few
      the higher executive was veiled in mystery&mdash;the revelations of
      obscure and ordinary traitors would therefore prove unavailing&mdash;and
      he who could denounce the Secret Directory must be a member himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The traitor who had betrayed the elements of this huge conspiracy found
      his confidences well kept. Documents, whose authenticity cannot be called
      in question, are in existence, and furnish irrefragable proof of Mr.
      Thomas Reynolds having received for his disclosures not £500 only, but the
      sum of £5000 in four payments, at the following dates, and in the
      following amounts:&mdash;

</pre>
    <p>
      In all these curious disclosures is revealed the fact that, owing to the
      sensitive conscience of the informer, he in all received a very
      comfortable sum&mdash;including an annuity of £1000 per annum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, on the 14th of June 1799 Mr. Reynolds received his annuity of
      £1000, &lsquo;in full to the 25th March 1799; from which period till his death,
      the 18th of August 1836, his pension continued to be paid to him.

      Reynolds&rsquo;s information was the arrest of the whole provincial committee,
      consisting of fifteen members, delegates from different societies. They
      had assembled at the house of Oliver Bond, in Bridge Street, on the 12th
      of March, and were completely surprised by Captain Swan, attended by a
      dozen soldiers in coloured clothes. Several important papers were found
      upon the persons of the conspirators, some written by Byrne, and others by
      John M&rsquo;Cann&mdash;and both these unfortunate men subsequently underwent
      the extreme penalty of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The arrest at Bond&rsquo;s was followed up by many others, and most of the
      Leinster delegates were promptly seized and imprisoned, while others were
      denounced. Among the former were Emmett, Sweetman, Jackson, and Macnevin;
      among the latter Lord Edward Fitzgerald, Sampson, and McCormick.
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences of the fatal occurrence can be readily imagined. The loss
      of their leaders created confusion and distrust&mdash;that they had been
      betrayed was evident, and yet none could point to the betrayer. No wonder
      that men implicated in the conspiracy trembled for themselves&mdash;treason
      was abroad&mdash;and what added terror to that knowledge was that none
      could name the individual, and hence all was vague apprehension, more
      heart depressing than actual but open danger.

      The effect of this fetal discovery was equally injurious to the interests

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> month wore on.
      Every day the chances of a successful rising became more gloomy;
      disclosures were hourly made; and it became quite evident to the
      revolutionary leaders that the Government had penetrated their most secret
      plans, and were prepared to crush the conspiracy. As the arms and
      ammunition of the malcontents were detected and seized, the hands of the
      Executive were proportionately strengthened as the offensive power of the
      disaffected became less formidable. Supplementary corps of loyalists were
      armed and embodied; and those to whom the destinies of Ireland were
      entrusted assumed now an air of stern determination equally inflexible and
      appalling to the guilty. Daily a French invasion appeared a more
      improbable event. At last the truth became apparent that it was hopeless
      to expect foreign assistance; and the blow must be struck by the
      conspirators, unaided and alone.

    <p>
      <span class="head">THE DATE OF RISING FIXED</span>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>ccordingly, the
      night of the 23rd May was appointed for a general insurrection; and the
      signal for a rising <i>en mane</i> was to be the destruction or detention
      of the mail coaches after they had left the metropolis, while the counties
      and districts were left generally to the direction of local leaders; the
      insurrectionary movement in the capital embraced a simultaneous attack on
      the castle, the prisons, and military posts, the artillery barracks at
      Chapelizod, and the camp at Laughlinstown, seven miles south of Dublin.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the foreknowledge of the movements of the United Irishmen was
      evidently furnished by the informer Reynolds, who, strange to relate, had
      successfully eluded detection. In making his terms with the Government the
      traitor had prudently insisted upon his condition, that the channels
      through which the information came should remain for some time a secret; a
      stipulation in which his employers were no less interested than himself,
      as, by wearing still the mask of a friend, he could retain still the
      confidence of those he was betraying, and whatever victims his first aim
      had missed might, from the same ambush, be made sure of afterwards. In
      pursuance of this policy we find him, as he himself admits, paying a
      friendly visit to Mrs. Bond, two or three days after he had marked her
      husband for death; and even to Lord Fitzgerald&mdash;whose place of
      concealment at this moment was kept secret, as we shall see, from his own
      family&mdash;Reynolds, under the trust reposed in him, found ready
      admittance. Lord Edward was at once the head and arm of the seditious
      movement.

    <p>
      <span class="head">THE UNFORTUNATE LORD EDWARD FITZGERALD</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he name of Lord
      Edward stands out as that of the most conspicuous actor in this lurid
      history of the Irish Rebellion, as a personage whose birth, talents,
      energies, and enthusiasm obtained for him an unhappy pre-eminence. The
      fifth son of the Duke of Leinster, Lord Edward was nobly born by the
      maternal side, his mother being the daughter of Charles, Duke of Richmond.
      When Lord Edward was ten years old the Duke of Leinster died, and after a
      brief widowhood his relict remarried, and removing to France, there Lord
      Edward commenced his education, which appears to have been hurried and
      imperfect. Subsequently, after remaining for a short time with the Sussex
      militia, he obtained a commission in the line, joined the 96th regiment in
      Ireland; exchanged into the 19th, embarked for America, with which England
      was then at war, and, landing at Charlestown, was placed under the command
      of Lord Rawdon (Lord Moira), and afterwards attached to the staff of that
      spirited commander.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here the young soldier had an opportunity of witnessing field service for
      the first time, and in one important branch of the profession&mdash;outpost
      duty&mdash;it afforded frequent opportunities of exhibiting tact and
      address, as well as personal courage. With these qualities Lord Edward was
      abundantly gifted, and apparently a contempt for danger, carried to
      rashness. Owing to ill-health Lord Rawdon left Carolina for England, and
      Lord Edward rejoined his regiment (the 19th), when Greene attacked Stuart
      at Eutaw Springs, the result of which was a gallant and very doubtful
      action. Lord Edward, with his accustomed daring, was closely engaged,
      wounded in the leg, and left upon the field.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this helpless situation he was found by a poor negro, who carried him
      off on his back to his hut, and there nursed him most tenderly till he was
      well enough of his wound to bear removing to Charlestown. The negro was
      the &lsquo;faithful&rsquo; Tony, whom in gratitude for the honest creature&rsquo;s kindness
      he now took into his service, and who continued devotedly attached to his
      noble master to the premature ending of his lordship&rsquo;s career.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the surrender of Cornwallis&rsquo;s army at York Town, Lord Edward joined
      the staff of General O&rsquo;Hara at St. Lucia; but, after a few months, he left
      the West Indies, returned home, and was nominated by his brother, the Duke
      of Leinster, member for the borough of Athy. Several years passed; his
      career appears to have been unsettled and undetermined&mdash;one while
      studying professionally at Woolwich, the next visiting Gibraltar and
      Lisbon, and subsequently the principal cities of Spain. In June 1788 he
      returned again to America, landed at Halifax, and proceeded to join the
      54th regiment, quartered at St. John&rsquo;s; and held a field officer&rsquo;s rank in
      the same corps, in which the celebrated political writer, Cobbett, was
      then acting as sergeant-major.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Edward appears&mdash;according to Moore&rsquo;s <i>Life and Death</i>&mdash;to
      have been a man of nervous excitability. We find him occasionally enacting
      &lsquo;Love&rsquo;s Slave&rsquo;&mdash;and, with all the ardour and inconstancy of Romeo,
      forgetting Rosalind for Juliet. Had circumstances permitted the chances
      are that he would have changed his military profession for the calm
      enjoyments of domestic happiness. But they did not&mdash;and hence,
      probably, &lsquo;an uneasy mind&rsquo; sent him a second time across the Atlantic to
      seek, in savage or primaeval life, employment for an ardent and
      impassioned spirit, which, under more fortunate circumstances, would have
      sought domestic and cultivated enjoyments.
    </p>
    <p>
      The active and careless character of his pursuits may be collected from an
      extract from one of numerous letters to his mother:&mdash;&lsquo;I have been out
      hunting, and like it very much&mdash;it makes me <i>un peu sauvage</i>, to
      be sure. You may guess how eager I am to try if I like the woods in winter
      as well as in summer. I believe I shall never again be prevailed on to
      live in a house. I long to teach you all how to make a good spruce bed.
      Three of the coldest nights we have had yet I slept in the woods with only
      one blanket, and was just as comfortable as in a room. It was in a party
      with General Carleton, we went about twenty miles from this to look at a
      fine tract of land that had been passed over in winter. You may guess how
      I enjoyed this expedition, being where, in all probability, there had
      never been but one person before.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      This excursion, no doubt, suggested to Lord Edward his subsequent overland
      journey direct from Fredericstown to Quebec.
    </p>
    <p>
      To modern adventurers the exploit would appear a commonplace essay, but at
      the time the expedition was devised and accomplished, few excepting an
      Indian or backwoodsman would have voluntarily undergone the real and
      imaginary hardships of the journey. After a thirty days&rsquo; pilgrimage the
      young adventurer reached Quebec. One incident written to his mother is
      characteristic: &lsquo;I must tell you a little more of the journey. After
      making the river we fell in with some savages, and travelled with them to
      Quebec; they were very kind to us, and said we were &ldquo;all one brother&rdquo;&mdash;all
      &ldquo;one Indian.&rdquo; They fed us the whole time we were with them. You would have
      laughed to have seen me carrying an old squaw&rsquo;s pack, which was so heavy I
      could hardly waddle under it. However, I was well paid whenever we
      stopped, for she always gave me the best bits, and most soup, and took as
      much care of me as if I had been her own son; in short I was quite <i>l&rsquo;enfant
      chéri</i>&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A final expedition he made <i>via</i> Detroit and Michilimackinack to New
      Orleans, seems to have confirmed his Indian predilections, and led to his
      adoption into the Bear Tribe,&mdash;an honour upon which Lord Edward
      prided himself no little. From New Orleans he embarked for England, and
      for the three years succeeding his career was passed in England and
      Ireland without important occurrences to mark them, beyond the outbreak of
      the great French Revolution, that prodigious social and political upheaval
      which turned the heads of Europe. This terrible cataclysm intoxicated the
      Irish sympathisers, who, valorous for liberty, were blind to its excesses.
      This <i>bouleversement</i> fascinated the imaginations of the men who
      aspired to copy its progressive developments, and to leave their record
      heroically impressed upon Irish history; the Emmett brothers, Wolf Tone,
      the brothers Sheares, Lord Edward himself, and many other enthusiasts&mdash;the
      guiding spirits of the Irish insurrection&mdash;drew their inspirations
      from the Gallic font. They were friends and developed into
      fellow-conspirators. For instance, take the names last mentioned. Henry
      and John Sheares were brothers, and sons of a banker in Cork. They had
      received a liberal education, and both had been called to the Irish bar.
      Travelling, during the wildest period of the French Revolution, they
      became residents in Paris while the reign of terror was at its height,
      and, as it has been stated, witnessed the horrible scenes enacted daily
      under the tyranny of Robespierre, with an apathy from which accomplished
      and civilised gentlemen should have recoiled. The fearless manner in which
      their political opinions were promulgated exposed them to the suspicions
      of the Executive, and shortly before the Irish conspiracy broke out,&mdash;thanks
      to the revelations on the part of the traitor-informer, which at one swoop
      cut off the entire corps of directing spirits&mdash;they were arrested and
      confined.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Edward, more practical than his philosophic friends, had notoriously
      learned to act while they were &lsquo;philosophising;&rsquo; he too had been educated
      in the school of the French Revolution, with the arch leading spirit of
      which violent movement he had connected himself by family ties. When
      France declared herself a republic in 1792, and the Duke of Orleans&mdash;&lsquo;the
      enigma of the revolution,&rsquo; as Lamartine pronounces him&mdash;had voted for
      the death of the king, his kinsman, possibly realising a similar fate
      overhung his own head, Lord Edward was too enthusiastic to lose such a
      spectacle of moral and political excitement, and hastened over to Paris
      without communicating his intentions even to the Duchess, and to that
      fatal visit, as his biographer Moore avers, his subsequent misfortunes
      must be traced. His wild and hasty attachment to French principles&mdash;for
      he became almost a personage of the French Revolution, and is mentioned in
      Lamartine&rsquo;s <i>History</i>&mdash;his introduction to Madame de Sillery (de
      Genlis), <i>gouvernante</i> to the Orleans children, his falling
      desperately in love with the notoriously bewitching and <i>spirituelle</i>
      &lsquo;Pamela,&rsquo; natural daughter of the <i>Egalité</i> Duke of Orleans by the
      lady <i>gouvernante</i> already mentioned, are matters of history. Pamela,
      on all accounts, was sufficiently fascinating to account for so romantic
      an attachment, and Lord Edward was in himself a perfect hero of romance,
      and was made all the more interesting, even in France, by this tender
      episode. After this union his dismissal from the British army, his return
      to Ireland with his bride, the surpassingly charming Frenchwoman, are
      merely personal details. Had not Lord Edward been steeped in the practical
      development of the Irish rebellion, his political career would have
      subsided in favour of that domestic felicity of which he sent his mother
      the following artless and sympathetic picture:&mdash;

      &lsquo;My little place is much improved by a few things I have done, and by all
      <i>my planting</i>; by the bye, I doubt if I told you of my flower garden,&mdash;I
      got a great deal from Frescati. I have been at Kildare since Pam&rsquo;s
      lying-in, and it looked delightful, though all the leaves were off the
      trees, but so comfortable and snug. I think I shall pass a delightful
      winter there. I have got two fine large clumps of turf, which look both
      comfortable and pretty. I have paled in my little flower-garden before my
      hall door with a lath paling like the cottage, and stuck it full of roses,
      sweetbriar, honeysuckles, and Spanish broom. I have got all my beds ready
      for my flowers; so you may guess how I long to be down to plant them. The
      little fellow will be a great addition to the party. I think when I am
      down there with Pam and child of a blustering evening, with a good turf
      fire and a pleasant book, coming in after seeing my poultry put up, my
      garden settled, flower beds and plants covered for fear of frost,&mdash;the
      place looking comfortable and taken care of, I shall be as happy as
      possible; and sure I am I shall regret nothing but not being nearer my
      dearest mother, and her not being of our party. It is indeed a drawback,
      and a great one, our not being more together. Dear Malvern! how pleasant
      we were there; you can&rsquo;t think how this time of year puts me in mind of
      it. Love always. Your affectionate son, E. F.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Moore significantly comments: &lsquo;In reading these simple and, to an almost
      feminine degree, fond letters, it is impossible not to feel how strange
      and touching is the contrast between those pictures of a happy home which
      they so unaffectedly exhibit, and that dark and troubled sea of conspiracy
      and revolt into which the amiable writer of them so soon afterwards
      plunged; nor can we easily bring ourselves to believe that the joyous
      tenant of this little Lodge, the happy husband and father, dividing the
      day between his child and his flowers, could be the same man who, but a
      year or two after, placed himself at the head of the rebel myriads,
      negotiated on the frontiers of France for an alliance against England, and
      but seldom laid down his head on his pillow at night without a prospect of
      being summoned thence to the scaffold or the field.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the crisis of the conspiracy the hopes of the disaffected almost
      centred in this individual, who has left a memory behind which commands
      the admiration of many&mdash;the pity, I believe, of all. His earlier
      history we have already sketched, and the more painful duty of describing
      its hurried and unhappy close now devolves upon us. Meanwhile Lord Edward,
      as a military leader, devoted himself to arming and disciplining the
      people whose grievances he was preparing to redress by force.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the high estimation in which his military character was held by
      the United Irishmen was justly merited or not, is a question that can
      never be determined. He had many essential qualities to command popular
      respect, and fit him to become a revolutionary leader&mdash;high birth,
      family influence, singleness of purpose, devotion not to be mistaken, and
      courage beyond a doubt. But he seems to have been a self-willed and most
      imprudent man, and, if his biography may be credited, the last person upon
      earth to whose absolute direction a nation&rsquo;s fate, and the fortunes of a
      mighty and complicated movement, should have been entrusted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was perfectly notorious to the Government that Lord Edward was deeply
      implicated in the conspiracy; that he was the life and spirit of the plot,
      the hope of the revolutionists, and the selected leader of the intended
      insurrection. When the arrest at Bond&rsquo;s, due to Reynolds&rsquo;s treacherous
      disclosures, had fallen like the stroke of a thunderbolt upon the Union,
      and paralysed the boldest, it was whispered in that gloomy hour that Lord
      Edward had escaped abroad, and therefore the cause was not altogether
      desperate. That he had not been found at the secret meeting of the
      Leinster committee was a heavy disappointment to the Executive. It was
      true that, in the seizure of the delegates, the conspiracy had received a
      stunning blow, but it was &lsquo;scotched, not killed.&rsquo; Lord Edward was at
      liberty, and consequently the masterspirit was abroad. On the score of
      humanity, of policy, or both, it had been hinted by the Irish Government
      that his escape would be connived at, and the ports left open, if he would
      secretly quit the kingdom. Mr. Ogilvie, Lord Edward&rsquo;s foster-father,
      hastened to Dublin, and interviewed Lord Clare; the Lord Chancellor
      expressed himself with the most friendly warmth on the subject,
      counselling Lord Edward&rsquo;s stepfather: &lsquo;For God&rsquo;s sake get this young man
      out of the country; the ports shall be thrown open to you, and no
      hindrance whatever offered.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The offer was conveyed to Lord Edward, and rejected by him; no course
      remained but to apprehend him if possible, and thus deprive the hydra of
      its head. Among others, he was afterwards denounced by proclamation dated
      the nth of May, and £1000 offered for such secret information as might
      lead to his arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      On quitting Leinster House, the first place where Lord Edward sought
      concealment was the domicile of a widow lady situated on the banks of the
      canal. Thither, three nights after the surprise of the Leinster committee,
      he was conveyed in disguise, and there he remained a month undiscovered,
      although, with an imprudence not pardonable in a leader on whose safety a
      mighty movement hinged, he too frequently exposed himself to detection.
      For the feelings of the lover-husband, that would induce him to risk
      everything to visit an idolised wife and the children, even a callous
      heart would find or frame an apology. As Moore relates: &lsquo;Her ladyship had
      immediately, on the disappearance of Lord Edward, removed from the Duke of
      Leinster&rsquo;s to a house in Denzel Street, taking with her an attached female
      servant and the negro Tony, her husband&rsquo;s favourite. The two latter
      believed, as did most people, that their master had fled to France, and it
      was therefore with no small surprise that the maidservant saw, in going
      into her lady&rsquo;s room late in the evening, his lordship and Lady Edward
      sitting together by the light of the fire. The youngest child had, at his
      desire, been brought down out of its bed for him to see it, and both he
      and Lady Edward were, as the maid thought, in tears.&rsquo; Circumstanced as he
      was, unnecessary exposure was unpardonable. His person might be considered
      a sort of public property, and yet we find him walking most nights along
      the banks of the canal, jumping in and out of boats to amuse a child he
      had made his companion, and afterwards by sheer recklessness falsifying
      the incognito of an assumed name.
    </p>
    <p>
      How Lord Edward could have evaded detection so long appears astonishing.
      An enormous reward was offered for his detection, and, as the plot became
      further unfolded, the alarm of the Government for its own existence
      superseded every other thought, and all considerations of mercy were lost
      in their fears. At the period, therefore, where we are now arrived, the
      search after his lordship was, by the emissaries of authority, pursued
      with as much eagerness as political zeal, urged by fear and revenge, could
      inspire.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Edward at last seemed awakened to his danger, and it was considered
      by himself and friends that a longer residence where he was might be
      hazardous and lead to a discovery. Another asylum was accordingly provided
      for him at a feather merchant&rsquo;s house in Thomas Street, and at Murphy&rsquo;s,
      as the owner was called, he remained for several days in safety.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 30th March the kingdom had been declared by proclamation &lsquo;in actual
      rebellion,&rsquo; the troops were directed to act without magisterial authority
      whenever their own officers deemed it proper. This fearful order loosed a
      licentious soldiery upon the country, and every hope of averting bloodshed
      ended. As the great object of the revolutionary leaders was to prevent a
      premature explosion, agents were despatched to hold out encouragement to
      the disaffected that a French invasion would speedily be reattempted. But
      a double failure had damped the expectations of the Directory. Hoche, the
      apostle of this adventurous policy, was in his grave; Bonaparte, bent on
      other objects, and unfriendly to an Irish demonstration; and without
      foreign assistance it became evident to the conspirators that &lsquo;themselves
      must strike the blow.&rsquo; The plot was on the verge of coming to a head.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the following fortnight Lord Edward&mdash;whose leadership counted for
      so much at the opportune and decisive moment of actual outburst&mdash;made
      Murphy&rsquo;s house his place of concealment. Even there he received company
      (some of his friends were regarded as traitors to the cause), walked out
      at night, and, disguised in women&rsquo;s clothes, visited Lady Edward in Denzel
      Street. He then changed his residence, and sought shelter in the houses of
      tradesmen, named Moore and Corwick, situated in the same street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some circumstances gave alarm to his friends, and Lord Edward a second
      time was conducted to his suburban retreat, and placed again in charge of
      his former hostess. Things were approaching a climax. On the 11th of May
      the proclamation that offered L.1000 for his apprehension appeared; the
      day for the insurrection was appointed; John Sheares despatched to Cork to
      raise the southern rebels; and, for the purpose of holding a closer
      communion with the Dublin leaders, Lord Edward quitted the house of his
      faithful protectress on the 13th May, and on the 18th he re-entered
      Murphy&rsquo;s, and only left it on the 19th for a cell, wherein to linger out a
      few miserable days, and expire in the common jail, without a friend or
      relative to watch &lsquo;the spirit&rsquo;s parting&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">THE ARREST OF LORD EDWARD FITZGERALD</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t was evident that
      the Government were cognisant of these plans. The date of the rising had
      been determined, Lord Edward was to head the movement; his commanding
      officer&rsquo;s uniform was ready, but it was preordained that the
      commander-in-chief of the rebel forces would never appear in it. From this
      distant point of view the operations of the Government resembled the
      movements of the watchful cat prepared to spring upon the doomed mouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the night preceding the 18th of May it was arranged that Lord Edward,
      the hero and hope of the movement, now on the eve of being declared
      openly, should resume his residence with Murphy in Thomas Street, and he
      set out, accordingly, under a strong escort of his followers. One of those
      affrays, of common occurrence in those days of terror&mdash;which this
      popular escort seemed destined to attract&mdash;resulted.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is quite evident from this occurrence that his betrayal was already
      complete. Of Lord Edward&rsquo;s intended movements Sirr, the Dublin town-major,
      had received certain information; and this officer was on the spot, ready
      prepared to stultify the plans of the conspirators. Sirr had with him a
      party for the purpose, and as either of two streets would have conducted
      Lord Edward to his destination, the town-major divided his myrmidons,&mdash;one
      section occupied Wading Street, the other was posted in Dirty Lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      A similar precaution happened to be adopted by Lord Edward&rsquo;s escort; there
      consequently ensued in both these streets a conflict between the parties.
      In the street affair John McCabe, a very active member of the United
      Irishmen, was seized and made a prisoner; he was afterwards tried,
      convicted, and executed. Lord Edward, by a miracle, was left free for the
      moment. Sirr, bearing the brunt of the struggle, found his opponents
      overstrong, and was nearly losing his life. In defending himself with a
      sword, which he had snatched from one of his assailants, he lost his
      footing and fell; and had not those with whom he was engaged in a
      hand-to-hand scuffle been much more occupied with their noble charge than
      with him, Sirr could hardly have escaped. A pistol or two was snapped at
      the fallen officer, and the group passed on with Lord Edward to Murphy&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was under surveillance. On the morning following, evidently the
      eve of the insurrection, the generalissimo of the United Irishmen&rsquo;s
      uniform&mdash;dark green, faced with scarlet&mdash;was delivered by an old
      woman to Murphy. This &lsquo;his already nervous host&rsquo; concealed under
      goat-skins in his warehouse. At noon a party of soldiers suddenly entered
      the street, and suspiciously halted before Moore&rsquo;s house, the man who had
      formerly sheltered Lord Edward. Alarmed for the safety of his guest, the
      feather merchant conveyed him by a trap door to the roof of his warehouse,
      and in one of the valleys which ran between the houses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Edward remained for two or three hours, until the alarm had subsided,
      and the soldiers had left the street.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the usual hour dinner was served, and Neilson, a constant and most
      imprudent visitor, was invited to join Murphy and his noble guest. The
      cloth &lsquo;had not been many minutes removed, when Neilson, as if suddenly
      recollecting something, hurried out of the room and left the house;
      shortly after which, Mr. Murphy, seeing that his guest was not inclined to
      drink any wine, went downstairs. In a few minutes, however, returning, he
      found that his lordship had, in the interim, gone to his bedroom, and, on
      following him thither, saw him lying without his coat upon the bed. There
      had now elapsed, from the time of Neilson&rsquo;s departure, not more than ten
      minutes, and it is asserted that he had, in going out, left the hall door
      open.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>

      <a href="images/0449.jpg"><img src="images/enlarge.jpg" alt="" /> </a>
    </h5>
    <p>
      At this moment Major Sirr, who had but just received an intimation from
      the Castle of the place where Lord Edward was concealed, proceeded in
      hackney-coaches to arrest him, attended by eight soldiers in coloured
      clothes, and accompanied by Captains Swan and Ryan. While Sirr was
      disposing the soldiers below to prevent any chance of escape, Swan hurried
      upstairs, entered the apartment, and, approaching the bed, told Lord
      Edward that he was a prisoner. Lord Edward jumped out of bed, and Swan,
      perceiving that he was determined on resistance, snapped, or, as others
      say, discharged a pistol ineffectually, and then closing with his
      antagonist, both rolled upon the bed. In the struggle which ensued Lord
      Edward stabbed his opponent on the hand and body repeatedly, when Ryan
      entered the chamber and rushed to the assistance of his companion, lunging
      at Lord Edward with a cane-sword, which, however, turned on the ribs, and
      only inflicted a flesh wound. All three fell on the floor together; in the
      <i>mêlée</i> which followed Ryan received a mortal stab, and when Sirr
      entered he found Lord Edward on his feet endeavouring to reach the door,
      while Swan and Ryan held on desperately by the legs to prevent it.
      Threatened as he was with a fate similar to his companions, Sirr had no
      alternative but to fire, and aiming his pistol deliberately, he lodged the
      contents in Lord Edward&rsquo;s right arm near the shoulder. The wound for a
      moment staggered him; but as he again rallied, and was pushing towards the
      door, Major Sirr called up the soldiers, and so desperate were the
      captive&rsquo;s struggles that they found it necessary to lay their firelocks
      across him before he could be disarmed or bound so as to prevent further
      mischief. Clearly the powers would have preferred to take this unfortunate
      and embarrassing prisoner dead&mdash;the history of the affair makes this
      evident&mdash;three attempts all more or less deliberate had been made on
      the captive&rsquo;s life in the short encounter.
    </p>
    <p>
      An eminent surgeon was immediately brought to the assistance of the
      wounded men; Ryan&rsquo;s injury was pronounced the most dangerous&mdash;he had
      commenced his share in the affray by attempting to run their captive
      through the body. Swan&rsquo;s wounds, though numerous, were not severe, and on
      examination Dr. Adreen expressed an opinion that Lord Edward&rsquo;s were not
      mortal. The surgeon&rsquo;s communication elicited a brief but significant
      remark, &lsquo;I am sorry, doctor, to hear it&rsquo;!
    </p>
    <p>
      On the arrival of a cavalry picket and the Rainsford Street guard the
      wounded men were removed, and Lord Edward was taken to the Castle in a
      sedan, and carried into the office of the Secretary of the War Department.
      On his arrest being communicated to Lord Camden, orders were given that
      the State surgeon should instantly examine and dress his wounds; while
      with a feeling honourable to his well-known humanity, the Viceroy
      transmitted by his own secretary a private message to the noble prisoner,
      giving him an assurance of receiving every indulgence consistent with
      personal safety. The message was conveyed by Mr. Watson, whose account of
      the melancholy interview is graphic and interesting. &lsquo;I found Lord Edward
      leaning back on a couple of chairs, his arm extended, and supported by the
      surgeon, who was dressing the wound. His countenance was pallid, but
      serene; and when I told him, in a low voice, not to be overheard, my
      commission from the Lord Lieutenant, and that I was going to break the
      intelligence of what had occurred to Lady Edward, asking him, with every
      assurance of my fidelity and secrecy, whether there was any confidential
      communication he wished to be made to her ladyship, or whether I could
      undertake any other act of personal kindness in his service, he answered
      merely, but collectedly, &ldquo;No, no, thank you&mdash;nothing, nothing&mdash;only
      break it to her tenderly.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      After a delay of several hours, during which time his wounds had been
      carefully attended to, Lord Edward was removed to Newgate under a strong
      military guard, and placed in Lord Aid-borough&rsquo;s room. As the carriage and
      escort passed from the Castle to the prison, the countenances and
      demeanour of the disaffected indicated how deeply they felt the loss of
      the leader on whom they had placed so much dependence. To attempt a rescue
      was determined, and, in full assurance that the effort would be made, the
      garrison remained under arms throughout the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 31st of May Captain Ryan died of his wounds, but it was considered,
      though the heat of the weather was against him, that Lord Edward would
      recover. Attended by a kind-hearted militia officer named Stone, and
      constantly visited by the State surgeon, there is no doubt that the
      severity attendant on his confinement as imputed to the authorities was
      exaggerated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lord Edward lingered to the 1st June, when his wounds assumed an unhealthy
      appearance and fever set in; the death of Captain Ryan had transpired, and
      the knowledge that his victim was no more added poignant sorrow to a mind
      already excited too seriously. It is said that the confusion and noise
      attending on the execution of a young man named Clinch increased this
      mental irritation. On the 2nd of June Lord Edward became delirious, and
      the attendance of a keeper from a mad-house was deemed necessary. On the
      3rd reason returned, but his strength had sunk completely. The authorities
      gave a tardy consent for his brother and sister to visit him, a concession
      Lord Clare had seen fit to withhold until the last. Lady Louisa Conolly
      relates they saw he was cast for death&mdash;&lsquo;The two dear brothers
      frequently embraced each other, to the melting of a heart of stone; and
      yet God enabled both Henry and myself to remain quite composed. As every
      one left the room we told him we only were with him. He said, &ldquo;That is
      very pleasant.&rdquo; However, he remained silent, and I then brought in the
      subject of Lady Edward, and told him I had not left her until I saw her on
      board; and Henry told him of having met her on the road well. He said,
      &ldquo;And the children, too? She is a charming woman,&rdquo; and then became silent
      again. That expression about Lady Edward proved to me that his senses were
      much lulled, and that he did not feel his situation to be what it was;
      but, thank God! they were enough alive to receive pleasure from seeing his
      brother and me. Dear Henry, in particular, he looked at continually with
      an expression of pleasure.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately after Lord Henry and his sister had taken leave convulsions
      came on violently, and at two o&rsquo;clock in the morning of the 4th, a
      gallant, generous, and enthusiastic spirit&mdash;would that it had been
      better directed I&mdash;parted.
    </p>
    <p>
      After an inquest the body was interred in the cemetery of St. Werburgh,
      the funeral being conducted as privately as possible to prevent any
      exhibition of popular feeling, which, had it been more public, would have
      been certain to occur.

    <p>
      &lsquo;Under the conduct of your chosen leaders march with a steady step to
      victory. Heed not the glare of hired soldiery, or aristocratic yeomanry:
      they cannot stand the vigorous shock of freedom. Their trappings and their
      arms will soon be yours; and the detested Government of England, to which
      we vow eternal hatred, shall learn that the treasures it exhausts on its
      accoutred slaves for the purpose of butchering Irishmen shall but <i>further
      enable us to turn their swords on its devoted head</i>. Attack them in
      every direction by day and by night; avail the natural advantages of your
      country, which are and with which you are better acquainted than they.
      Where you cannot oppose them in full force constantly harass their rear
      and their flanks; cut off their provisions and magazines, and prevent them
      as much as possible from uniting their forces; let whatever moments you
      cannot devote to fighting for your country be passed in learning how to
      fight for it, or preparing the means of war&mdash;for war, war alone must
      occupy every mind and every hand in Ireland, until its long-oppressed soil
      be purged of all its enemies. Vengeance, Irishmen, vengeance on your
      oppressors. Remember that thousands of your dearest friends have perished
      by their merciless orders. Remember their burnings, their rackings, their
      torturings, their military massacres, and their legal murders. Remember
      Orr!&rsquo;

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he crisis hurried
      on rapidly. On the morning of the 21st, the Viceroy officially to the Lord
      Mayor, and the day following, through Lord Castlereagh, apprised the House
      of Commons, &lsquo;that his Excellency had received information that the
      disaffected had been daring enough to form a plan for the purpose of
      possessing themselves, in the course of the present week, of the
      metropolis, of seizing the seat of Government, and those in authority
      within the city; that, in consequence of that information, he had directed
      every military precaution to be taken which seemed expedient; that he had
      made full communication to the magistrates for the direction of their
      efforts; and that he had not a doubt, by the measures which would be
      pursued, the designs of the rebellious would be effectually and entirely
      crushed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A spirited and dutiful answer was voted by the Commons. &lsquo;The Speaker and
      all the members immediately waited on his Excellency with the address; and
      to show their zeal, and to increase the solemnity of the proceedings, they
      walked through the streets on foot, two and two, preceded by the Speaker,
      the sergeant-at-arms, and all the officers of the house.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The 23rd of May, a day that must ever carry with it deplorable
      recollections, dawned upon a city destined before another sun should rise
      to undergo every horror that attends a civil war. A gloom overspread the
      countenances of the royalists. Enough had been communicated by the
      Executive to convince the most sceptical that the long portending
      thundercloud was on the eve of bursting&mdash;and still the moment of
      actual insurrection continued veiled in impenetrable mystery.
    </p>
    <p>
      Evening came, and no positive information of revolutionary outbreak as yet
      had reached the Castle. A Government spy, late in the day, communicated
      authentic intelligence, that the picket of yeomanry cavalry at Rathfarnham
      would that night be surprised and cut off, and, consequently, instead of a
      sergeant&rsquo;s party the whole troop mounted for patrol. After narrowly
      escaping an ambush, Lieutenant La Touche ascertained that the rebels had
      actually risen, and an express, carried by a trooper called Bennett, was
      immediately despatched to apprise the Lord Lieutenant of the insurrection.
      The duty&mdash;one of the many instances of the zeal and personal
      gallantry with which the Irish yeomanry evidenced their fealty and
      devotion to the Government&mdash;was truly perilous, for the rebels in
      great numbers were collecting in the road and adjacent fields in the
      vicinity of Dublin. In the city, particularly the suburbs, the yeoman saw
      a great number of rebels with pikes, in the gateways, alleys, and
      stable-lanes, waiting the beat of their drums and the approach of rebel
      columns from the country which they were expecting; and as he passed they
      frequently cried out, animating each other, &lsquo;Come on, boys! who&rsquo;s afraid?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Immediately the garrison and yeomanry drums beat to arms, and the latter
      hurried to their alarm-posts. The North Cork Militia were formed in
      Stephen&rsquo;s Green, and the bridges of the canals, which stretch along the
      city north and south, were occupied by strong pickets. Those crossing the
      Liffey were also secured, and the communications completely interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      For some nights previous to the 23rd of May beacon fires were seen on the
      Wicklow mountains, whose luminous appearance by night and whose smoke by
      day served as signals to the disaffected in the metropolis and in all the
      adjacent country. The same practice took place on all the mountains which
      extend from the Scalp in the county of Wicklow to Mount Leinster in the
      county of Wexford.
    </p>
    <p>
      Where existed any necessity for this idle and unnecessary display, when
      all was organised and ready, and any striking exhibition must naturally
      add to the alarm which every prudential motive should have allayed? Why
      increase the fears and consequently the vigilance of the Executive? In
      secrecy of purpose lay success, and all was in favour of it could the
      authorities be lulled into a false and fatal security. The yeomanry corps,
      which in a few days afterwards were purified of traitors, at the moment of
      the outbreak abounded in United Irishmen, upon whom no shadow of suspicion
      had yet fallen. &lsquo;It was discovered,&rsquo; says Sir Richard Musgrave in his
      narrative, &lsquo;that near nine-tenths of the Roman Catholics in the yeomanry
      corps were United Irishmen, and had taken an oath to be true to the rebels
      in direct contradiction to their sworn allegiance, and yet many of them,
      after taking the United oath, had, by deliberate and pre-determined
      perjury, joined the yeomanry corps for the purpose of getting arms in
      their hands, learning the use of them, and turning them against the
      loyalists perhaps in the very moment of danger. In the subsequent
      development of the conspiracy there occurred direct evidence of the
      loyalist corps deliberately joining the rebels they were sworn to subdue
      at the critical juncture of the encounters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The domestic servants of Dublin were deeply engaged in the conspiracy, and
      hence every action of their employers was revealed, and the safety of
      every house was compromised. Even the lamplighters lent their assistance,
      and darkness was prearranged to assist&mdash;as it would do most
      effectively&mdash;a sudden outburst, by neutralising the advantages which
      daylight secures to disciplined troops in a conflict with fierce and
      tumultuary assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been already mentioned that the stoppage of the mail-coaches was to
      be the signal for a general rising. On the evening of the 23rd, at Santry,
      the Belfast mail was burned; the Limerick stopped on the Curragh of
      Kildare, and both guard and coachman murdered; the Athlone coach was
      destroyed at Lucan, and the Cork mail at Naas.
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of petty affairs followed the instant outbreak of the rebellion,
      all characterised by the atrocities attending civil war. In these affairs
      the rebels were generally repulsed; but in a few they unhappily succeeded,
      and always by surprise, treachery, or the imprudence of the royalists. Of
      these we shall meet instances in the course of our illustrations. As
      regards the outbreak in the capital, naturally the capture of Dublin was
      the grand and primary object at which the conspirators unanimously aimed;
      and a simultaneous movement on the metropolis by the Kildare rebels was to
      have seconded the efforts of the disaffected within the city. Everything
      was in favour of success; and, as the garrison was almost drained of
      regular troops, and its safety entrusted to the yeomanry, that
      circumstance was not overlooked by the rebel leaders. In barracks soldiers
      cannot be easily surprised; a few taps from the drum, and a very few
      minutes are quite sufficient to place a regiment in battle order; but to
      collect irregulars, dispersed and distant from the alarm-posts they have
      been directed to assemble at, is a work of time, and equally difficult and
      precarious, as, in an attempt to reach the posts assigned, individuals and
      isolated parties are readily intercepted and overpowered.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the great design of the insurgents, and nothing could have been
      more easily effected when aided by the darkness of night and the
      intricacies of a city crowded with houses, and intersected by narrow
      lanes.
    </p>
    <p>
      By an unaccountable oversight the canals, which covered two sides of
      Dublin, had been left open, when by stockading the bridges they could have
      easily been rendered defensible, and have thus placed an impassable
      obstruction to any bodies who might approach the city from Kildare. Before
      the royalists occupied the bridges numbers of insurgents from the country
      had crossed over, and it was computed that by one northern turnpike more
      than two thousand strangers had entered the city during the evening and
      succeeding night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the chief plans propounded by the rebel leaders, the capture of the
      Castle with the high authorities it contained, the cutting off of the
      royalists in detached parties as they hurried to their respective
      alarm-posts at the beat to arms of rebel drums, with an attack on the jail
      of Newgate, the liberation of their friends the State prisoners there
      incarcerated, formed the grand objects of their midnight movement. The
      guiding spirit was evidently lacking, for the head had been cut off. On
      the plans of action there was a division of opinion among the existing
      leaders. John Sheares confined the intended operations of his followers to
      dealing with the Castle and disposing of the inmates. Neilson, it was
      arranged, should attack the jail. Accident interfered; neither plan had
      any success, and the leader found himself at midnight the inmate of the
      prison from which he had falsely calculated that he was going to liberate
      his imprisoned confederates.
    </p>
    <p>
      Southwell C. McClure, a rebel colonel, who had been pardoned, gave
      evidence that Neilson had made preparations for his task, and taken
      elaborate preparations for the carrying out of his plan on Newgate and
      cutting off the loyalist auxiliaries in detail. He had assembled at a
      house in Church Lane, a noted rendezvous for rebels, fifteen colonels
      representing as many battalions; to each of these leaders he had produced
      a map of Dublin, and assigned to each the post which each colonel and his
      regiment was to occupy that night. In his attack upon Newgate he was to
      have been seconded by a large body of rebels, headed by Seagrave, who was
      to have secured possession of Mr. Halpin&rsquo;s distillery, the windows of
      which flanked it, and they were to have kept up a constant fire on the
      front of the prison, while another party scaled the walls in a different
      quarter. Neilson&rsquo;s preparations promised to prove formidable, and at ten
      o&rsquo;clock this leader, having a body of rebels collected in some fields
      contiguous to-Eccles Street, proceeded to reconnoitre Newgate and point
      out the best points of attack to his supporters. Escalade, supported by a
      commanding fire of musketry, was the plan adopted, and from the manner in
      which the prison was domineered the attempt might have easily succeeded.
      In the most suspicious manner Neilson was always found doing compromising
      acts. His behaviour had helped to compromise Lord Edward&rsquo;s security, and
      on this occasion he seems to have deliberately sacrificed his plans and
      his safety at the critical juncture, and thus compromised the entire
      scheme.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some waste ground, then covered with heaps of market offal, and close to
      the prison, enabled a person to examine the building unperceived, and of
      this advantage Neilson, already well acquainted with the locality, had
      availed himself. In the darkness he trod upon a child, and the outcry
      brought its mother to the spot. The woman was drunk, an angry altercation
      followed, and no apology which Neilson could offer would conciliate the
      irritated poissarde. The noise naturally attracted attention; persons
      hastened to the spot, and among others Mr. Gregg, the jailor. Neilson,
      having already been in his custody, was perfectly familiar to Gregg. The
      latter immediately arrested him, a desperate resistance was offered, a
      pistol snapped, and a doubtful struggle ensued. Under a belief that
      Gregg&rsquo;s assault on Neilson was occasioned by his resentment of the injury
      offered to her child, the fishwoman so far contributed by her clamour to
      mystify the affray that the line of posts which Neilson had established
      between Newgate and Eccles Street thought the noise only a squabble of
      drunken fishwomen, and waited in idle expectation for Neilson&rsquo;s return and
      orders to advance, until the capture transpired in an hour or two, and the
      party took alarm and disbanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a popular movement failure or success at first generally decides its
      fortunes. The attempt on the capital signally miscarried. The
      master-spirit was wanting at the hour of action, and he who might have
      given a fatal direction to efforts ill-directed and uncombined, was, with
      his abler associates, immured within the walls of a prison. Upon
      individuals alike wanting in courage and ability the hurried choice of
      revolutionary leadership had fallen. If Neilson&rsquo;s imprudent visits to Lord
      Edward before the arrest subjected him to a charge of treachery
      afterwards, his conduct on the night he reconnoitred Newgate proves him to
      have been quite unfitted for command. That a man known to every turnkey
      should have personally examined a building in which he had been so long
      confined appeared, from its extreme rashness, almost to indicate
      indifference to the consequences of discovery.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>n the morning of
      the 24th two proclamations were issued&mdash;the one from General Lake,
      the other from Alderman Fleming. Both were stringent, but the
      circumstances of the times admitted of no temporising measures:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lieutenant-General Lake, commanding his Majesty&rsquo;s forces in this kingdom,
      having received from his Excellency the Lord Lieutenant full powers to put
      down the rebellion, and to punish rebels in the most summary manner,
      according to martial law, does hereby give notice to all his Majesty&rsquo;s
      subjects, that he is determined to exert the powers entrusted to him in
      the most vigorous manner for the immediate suppression of the same; and
      that all persons acting in the present rebellion, or in any way aiding or
      assisting therein, will be treated by him as rebels, and punished
      accordingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And Lieutenant-General Lake hereby requires all the inhabitants of the
      city of Dublin (the great officers of State, members of the houses of
      Parliament, privy councillors, magistrates, and military persons in
      uniform excepted) to remain within their respective dwellings from nine
      o&rsquo;clock at night till five in the morning, under pain of punishment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lord Mayor&rsquo;s proclamation was equally to the point and equally
      judicious:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Whereas the circumstances of the present crisis demand every possible
      precaution; these are therefore to desire all persons who have registered
      arms forthwith to give in, in writing, an exact list or inventory of such
      arms at the town-clerk&rsquo;s office, who will file and enter the same in books
      to be kept for that purpose. And all persons who have not registered these
      arms are hereby required forthwith to deliver up to me, or some other
      magistrate of this city, all arms and ammunition of every kind in their
      possession. And if, after this proclamation, any person having registered
      arms shall be found not to have given in a true list or inventory of such
      arms, or if any person who has not registered shall be found to have in
      their power or possession any arms or ammunition whatever, such person or
      persons will, on such arms being discovered, be forthwith sent on board
      his Majesty&rsquo;s navy, as by law directed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And I do hereby desire that all housekeepers do place upon the outside of
      their doors a list of persons in their respective houses, distinguishing
      such as are strangers from those who actually make part of their family;
      but as there may happen to be persons who, from pecuniary embarrassments,
      are obliged to conceal themselves, I do not require such names to be
      placed on the outside of the door, provided their names are sent to me.
      And I hereby call upon his Majesty&rsquo;s subjects within the county of the
      city of Dublin immediately to comply with this regulation, as calculated
      for the public security; as those persons who shall wilfully neglect a
      regulation so easy and salutary, as well as persons giving false
      statements of the inmates of their houses, must, in the present crisis,
      abide the consequences of such neglect.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">SURPRISE OF THE BARRACKS OF PROSPEROUS</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he outbreaks in
      the immediate vicinity of Dublin come next in the order of alike the
      chronological sequence of events and of the illustrations. Slight affairs
      occurred on the night of the 23rd, and upon the following day. At
      Rathfarnham, Lucan, Lusk, Collan, and Baltinglass the royalists and rebels
      came in contact, and the latter were repulsed. At Dunboyne and Barretstown
      the escorts of some baggage (Reay and Suffolk Fencibles) were surprised.
      On the succeeding day Clane, Naas, Ballymore-Eustace, Kilcullen, and
      Prosperous were attacked, and with the exception of the latter, in every
      effort the rebels were unsuccessful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prosperous, a small but thriving town, then generally inhabited by persons
      manufacturing cottons, is seventeen miles from Dublin. It was garrisoned
      by a detachment of the North Cork Militia, some forty men under Captain
      Swayne, with a lieutenant and twenty of the Ancient British Cavalry. The
      infantry occupied a temporary barrack, half the cavalry were quartered in
      an opposite house, and the remainder in single billets. On the Sunday
      (20th) previous to the outbreak Swayne arrived in Prosperous with his
      detachment. He attended at the chapel with Dr. Esmond, a man of great
      local influence, and then implored the people there assembled to deliver
      up any arms which might be concealed, return to their allegiance, and
      receive the protection he was authorised to grant them. This exhortation
      proved ineffectual; some coercive measures&mdash;such as the seizure of
      cattle, then warranted by martial law&mdash;were resorted to; and on the
      23rd it was intimated that fear had hitherto prevented the peasantry from
      bringing the concealed arms to the town, and that should they be permitted
      to enter after dark, unchallenged and unmolested, on the following night,
      pikes and firearms would be brought in and deposited in the streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is difficult to decide whether the stupidity of Swayne or the treachery
      of Esmond were most to be condemned. A man individually may trifle with
      himself, but for him who turns right or left from the plain path which
      duty points to, and compromises the safety of those committed to his
      charge, there can be no extenuation. For Swayne&rsquo;s folly there can be no
      apology&mdash;his pickets should have been doubled&mdash;a cart, a ladder
      drawn across the street, would have marked sufficiently where those who
      came to surrender arms might approach with full security. A step beyond
      it, if the challenge failed, the advanced sentry shot the intruder, and
      the garrison was at once alarmed. So much for Captain Swayne. His weakness
      was inexcusable&mdash;he died its victim&mdash;ignobly certainly, but
      still by the weapon of a foeman. Esmond met the doom he merited&mdash;a
      halter. Mus-grave&rsquo;s account of the surprise is authentic:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At two o&rsquo;clock on Thursday morning, the 24th May, the two sentinels were
      surprised and killed; and both the barracks were assaulted while the
      soldiers were fast asleep. The barracks of the Cork company consisted of a
      hall, an apartment on each side, the same in the next storey, and
      underground offices. A party of the rebels rushed into Captain Swayne&rsquo;s
      apartment, which was on the ground floor, and murdered him. Some soldiers,
      who slept in the opposite apartment, alarmed at the noise, came forth with
      their firelocks and expelled those ruffians from the barrack, after having
      killed two or three of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The house was at that time surrounded with a great number of rebels
      variously armed. A fierce conflict ensued between the assailants and the
      besieged; but it was soon put an end to by the following malignant device
      of the former. There was a great quantity of straw in the underground
      office, to which the rebels set fire, and, to increase the flame,
      introduced some faggots into it. The soldiers were soon in a state of
      suffocation; and the heat being so great that they could not endure it,
      they retreated to their comrades in the upper storey; but the flames and
      smoke soon reached them there, as the rebels continued to introduce
      lighted faggots into the apartments under them. Enveloped with thick
      smoke, and overcome with heat, some of them leaped out of the windows, but
      were immediately received on the pikes of the assailants, who gave a
      dreadful yell whenever that occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At last the barrack being in a state of conflagration, the soldiers
      resolved to rush forward and fight their way through their assailants; but
      they, who were very numerous, formed a halfmoon round the front of the
      barrack, and received them on their pikes, so that but few of them
      escaped.5

      Nothing could have been more detestable than the treachery of Esmond;
      though lieutenant in the Armagh Militia, he actually planned and led the
      rebel surprise of Prosperous. He wore the royal uniform, and yet was false
      to the monarch to whom he had sworn allegiance. When men of desperate
      fortunes swerve from the path of honour poverty may be pleaded to
      extenuate, though not excuse. Esmond had no plea to offer&mdash;he was
      wealthy, well born, and respected. He might have proved a rebel, but why
      play the traitor? When in the house of God loyalty was on his lips, while
      the heart was contemplating bloodshed. Even the tie a savage venerates
      could not turn him from his truculent design,&mdash;and, while he devoted
      him to death, he shared his victim&rsquo;s hospitality&mdash;dined with Captain
      Swayne &lsquo;at an inn on the 23rd of May, and continued to enjoy the glow of
      social mirth with him, till a few hours before the perpetration of that
      bloody scene which he had for some time meditated.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of death at Prosperous was interrupted by intelligence conveyed
      to the insurgents, that at Clane, three miles off, their friends had been
      defeated&mdash;for although partly surprised, that little garrison
      succeeded in beating off their assailants.

    <p>
      <span class="head">ATTACK ON THE GARRISON AT CLANE</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">C</span>lane was occupied
      by a party of the Armagh Militia and some yeomanry cavalry. Early on the
      morning of the 24th a large body of armed rebels stole into the street.
      Fortunately there was just time to beat to arms, although such of the
      soldiers as were at single billets in the town were attacked as they
      issued from the houses where they had been quartered, and several of them
      killed and wounded before they could join their comrades. The guards,
      however, with great gallantry, held the rebels in check until their
      comrades hastily turned out and formed. A few well-directed volleys routed
      the rebels, and they were driven with considerable loss from the town; but
      deeming pursuit imprudent, the royalists returned, and again formed in the
      streets.
    </p>
    <p>
      At five in the morning the rebels made a second attempt, reinforced by the
      exulting rebels who had returned from their bloody deeds at Prosperous;
      supported by a column of pikemen and musketeers, a party mounted on the
      horses and furnished with the arms of the slaughtered Ancient Britons,
      whom they had cut off at Prosperous, charged boldly into Clane. A rolling
      volley from the royalists brought down half the party and dispersed the
      rest. They retired at gallop from the rebel column, which, from previous
      success of superior numbers, cut a strange but formidable appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      An affair highly honourable to the royalists resulted. &lsquo;As they were not
      strong enough to attack so numerous a party, and thinking it dishonourable
      to retreat, the captain, Griffiths, in concurrence with the militia
      officers, resolved to take post on an elevated spot near the commons,
      where they could not be surrounded or outflanked, and there they waited
      for the enemy, who began a smart fire on them, but without effect, as the
      elevation was too great. Our troops, having returned the fire, killed and
      wounded a considerable number of them, on which they fled in great dismay,
      and were charged by the captain and his sixteen yeomen, who cut down many
      of those whose heads were ornamented with the helmets of the Ancient
      Britons or the hats of the Cork regiment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A disorderly flight succeeded&mdash;the rebels totally disbanding, by
      throwing away their own ruder weapon the pike, with the firearms and
      sabres they had captured in the morning, and held in but brief possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      On re-entering Clane, Captain Griffiths was privately informed by a
      soldier named Philip Mite, that his own treacherous lieutenant had
      actually carried out the surprise of Prosperous. Having been ordered to
      march to Naas, at the moment when the troop were mounting, Esmond, in full
      accoutrements, joined it. The rash confidence that his treason was
      unsuspected proved ruinous to the unhappy man. He was arrested, forwarded
      to Dublin, tried, convicted, and hanged on Carlisle Bridge on the 14th of
      June.
    </p>
    <p>
      The insurrectionary occurrences at Ballymore-Eustace and Dunlavin
      simultaneously with those described, offer fearful pictures of the
      atrocious spirit with which a civil war is carried through.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>ncompromising
      severity does not always produce the intended effect. On some example may
      strike terror, in others it will excite undying hatred, and foster the
      worst spirit of the human heart&mdash;thirst for vengeance. Of this truth
      a retrospect of the events of these calamitous days gives evidence enough,
      and it is difficult now to determine on which side the excess of cruelty
      should be awarded. Assassination on one side was met upon the other with
      military executions&mdash;the royalists extenuating the act under the plea
      of necessity, while the rebel proclaimed that his murders were committed
      only from revenge.
    </p>
    <p>
      When admitting that a similar savageness of purpose might in many cases be
      charged against both sides, there all comparison must cease. No matter
      what the acts might be, the causes which produced them were totally
      dissimilar. The royalists took up arms for the protection of home and
      altar, which the fanaticism of Popery, or the accursed doctrines of the
      French revolutionists, were alike bent upon overturning. Allegiance to the
      king, and the maintenance of social order and an established government,
      urged the former to come forward; thousands perilled life and property
      from the purest motives; and when the insurrection was suppressed,
      sheathed the sword, drawn in the support of a matchless constitution,
      unstained by any act save those which resistance to rebellion had
      imperatively demanded. Those who have led a soldier&rsquo;s life and seen
      service in the field know that men become the creatures of circumstances.

      Let the gentlest spirit&mdash;and such are frequently united to the
      boldest heart&mdash;one that would not tread upon a worm or harm a
      sparrow, let him crown a defended breach, and he will use the bayonet
      unscrupulously. The feelings are influenced by the times; and if the
      royalists were sanguinary and unsparing, they could point to the
      atrocities of the insurgents, and bring forward established facts, so
      truculent and unwarranted, as to place those who committed them almost
      without the pale of mercy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Making every allowance for the political colouring given to his history of
      the times, and recollecting that he felt and wrote as a partisan, Sir
      Richard Musgrave narrates two well-authenticated instances of unprovoked
      cruelty among the many that marked the rebel outbreak in Kildare, which
      will sufficiently exhibit the ferocious spirit of the insurgents from the
      moment they flew to arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The following horrid circumstances,&rsquo; relates the historian, &lsquo;attended the
      murder of George Crawford and his grandchild, a girl of only fourteen
      years of age. He had formerly served in the 5th Dragoons, retired on a
      pension, and was permanent sergeant in Captain Taylor&rsquo;s corps of yeoman
      cavalry. He, his wife, and grand-daughter were stopped by a party of the
      rebels, as they were endeavouring to escape, and were reproached with the
      appellation of heretics because they were of the Protestant religion. One
      of them struck his wife with a musket, and another gave her a stab of a
      pike in the back, with an intent of murdering her. The husband, having
      endeavoured to save her, was knocked down, and received several blows of a
      firelock, which disabled him from making his escape. While they were
      disputing whether they should kill them, his wife stole behind a hedge and
      concealed herself. They then massacred her husband with pikes; and her
      grand-daughter having thrown herself on his body to protect him, received
      so many wounds that she instantly expired.

      These circumstances of atrocity have been verified by affidavit, sworn by
      Crawford&rsquo;s widow, the 20th day of August 1798. The fidelity of a large
      dog, belonging to this poor man, deserves to be recorded, as he attacked

      side perforated with pikes.&rsquo;

      <span class="head">STOPPAGE OF THE MAIL AND MURDER OF LIEUTENANT GIFFARD</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The second murder occurred on the same night. About eleven o&rsquo;clock the
      Limerick mail was stopped by a numerous banditti, and a gentleman was
      slaughtered under circumstances which elicited a lively sympathy. The
      sufferer was Lieutenant William Giffard, of the 82nd regiment, son of
      Captain John Giffard of the Dublin regiment.&rsquo; The savages having shot one
      of the horses so effectually to prevent the coach from proceeding,
      demanded of Lieutenant Giffard who and what he was, to which he answered,
      without hesitation, that he was an officer proceeding to Chatham in
      obedience to orders he had received. They demanded whether he was a
      Protestant; and being answered in the affirmative, they held a moment&rsquo;s
      consultation, and then told him that they wanted officers, that if he
      would take an oath to be true to them, and join them in an attack to be
      made next morning upon Monastereven, they would give him a command, but
      that otherwise he must die. To this the gallant youth replied, &lsquo;That he
      had already sworn allegiance to the king, that he would never offend God
      Almighty by a breach of that oath, nor would he disgrace himself by
      turning a deserter and joining the king&rsquo;s enemies; that he could not
      suppose a body of men would be so cruel as to murder an individual who had
      never injured them, and who was merely passing through them to a country
      from whence possibly he never might return; but if they insisted on their
      proposal he must die, for he never would consent to it!&rsquo; This heroic
      answer, which would have kindled sentiments of humanity in any breasts but
      those of Irish rebels, had the contrary effect, and with the utmost fury
      they assaulted him. He had a case of pistols, which natural courage and
      love of life, though hopeless, prompted him to use with effect, and being
      uncommonly active he burst from them, vaulted over a six feet wall, and
      made towards a house where he saw a light and heard people talking. Alas!
      it afforded no refuge! It was the house of poor Crawford whom, with his
      grand-daughter, they had just piked. A band of barbarians returning from
      this exploit met Lieutenant Giffard. There he fell, covered with wounds
      and glory, and his mangled body was thrown into the same ditch with honest
      Crawford and his innocent grandchild.

    <p>
      Shortly, in the course of his campaign, struggling to suppress the
      rebellion, Sir James Duffs movable column entered Kildare, when it passed
      close to the scene of slaughter, and poor Giffard&rsquo;s body was removed from
      the ditch and interred with military honours.

      <span class="head">COURSE OF THE INSURRECTION</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> course of
      cowardly assassination thus commenced was continued by the insurgents in
      their progress to attack Monastereven. Their numbers had increased to ten
      or twelve hundred men, and they were commanded by a ruffian called
      M&rsquo;Garry. Such Protestants as they unfortunately met with were put to
      death, and a solitary dragoon, seized as he crossed the Curragh, was
      inhumanly murdered. About four in the morning they approached the town and
      made their preparations for attacking it.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 24th of May there was not a regular soldier in Monastereven; and an
      infantry company, with a troop of horse, both yeomanry, formed the little
      garrison. After a feint on the canal, and a movement by the high road,
      which was repulsed by a charge of the cavalry, they pushed boldly into the
      town, and a warm conflict took place in the main street. The
      well-sustained musketry of the infantry threw the head of the rebel column
      into confusion, when the cavalry charged home, and the rout was complete.
      Fifty bodies were found lifeless in the town; and as the horsemen followed
      the flying rebels vigorously, as many more were cut up in the pursuit. The
      repulse of this attack was most honourable to the defenders of
      Monastereven. The gallant action was achieved by loyalists alone, and of
      the brave men who fought and bled that day fourteen of the troop were
      Roman Catholics.
    </p>
    <p>
      The outbreak of the 23rd of May was attended by many acts of cruelty
      inflicted upon isolated families, who, either from mistaken confidence or
      inability to reach a place of safety, exposed themselves to the fury of
      savages, whose natural truculence was often inflamed to madness by
      intoxication. Many individuals of great worth and respectability perished
      thus. Mr. Stamers, the chief proprietor of the town of Prosperous, was
      torn from the house of a lady where he had obtained a temporary shelter,
      and murdered in cold blood. Rathangan was, indeed, a scene of extensive
      butchery. Mr. Spencer and Mr. Moore were slaughtered there, although they
      had surrendered their arms on the assurance of being protected. They were
      murdered in the open street, and their wives had the horrible assurance
      that, with the shots they heard, the existence of their beloved partners
      had terminated. Thus Mr. Spencer, that worthy gentleman, &lsquo;who was an
      active and intelligent magistrate, and as remarkable for the amiableness
      and affability of his manner as the benevolence of his heart, fell a
      sacrifice to the fanaticism of those savages, to whom he had been
      unremittingly a kind and generous benefactor. As his house, at the hall
      door of which he was so brutally murdered, was a short distance from the
      town, Mrs. Spencer, who was led to it in the midst of these monsters, had
      the anguish to see the mangled corpse of her husband lying at his door&rsquo; 
      (Musgrave).
    </p>
    <p>
      A number of other victims were immolated by these bloodthirsty savages,
      and, until relieved by Colonel Longfield on the morning of the 28th,
      Rathangan was a constant scene of atrocity, in which even woman forgot her
      sex and barbarously participated. The murders at Rathangan, while they
      exasperated the royalists to acts of desperate retaliation, operated
      against the perpetrators in another and unexpected way. The few
      Protestants in Leinster and the south, who had mixed themselves with the
      conspiracy, suddenly became alarmed, for the war had now assumed a
      religious rather than a revolutionary complexion. Suspicion once aroused
      finds abundant causes to confirm it; and while some Protestants quietly
      seceded from their fellow-traitors, not a few sought favour with the
      Government by a secret betrayal of their guilty companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musgrave illustrates this point:&mdash;&lsquo;I shall mention here an incident
      which throws light on the spirit of the conspiracy and rebellion, and the
      secret designs of the great body of the rebels. One Dennis, an apothecary
      and a Protestant, was the county delegate and chief conductor of the plot
      in the King&rsquo;s County, which was to have exploded in a few days; but the
      wanton massacre of Protestants at Prosperous and Rathangan having
      convinced him that their extirpation was the main object of the Romanists,
      though they had with singular dissimulation concealed it from him who was
      their leader, he repaired to Tullamore to General Dunn, who commanded the
      district, threw himself on the mercy of Government, exposed the whole
      plot, and betrayed the names of the captains, who were immediately
      arrested. He said to the general, &ldquo;I see, sir, that it will soon be my own
      fate.&rdquo;&rsquo; In the course of this history nothing will be more apparent than
      the incompetency, military and diplomatic, of many of the functionaries to
      whom extensive powers were confided. One while unnecessary severity was
      employed, and at another mistaken lenity marred every advantage which
      stringent measures might have effected. In military conduct the royalist
      commanders were too often found deficient, and almost in every instance,
      either to imprudence or imbecility, the insurgents were alone indebted for
      moments of doubtful and envanescent success. The affair at Old Kilcullen
      was about one of the worst military offences committed by an incompetent
      commander. Yeomanry officers always behaved with boldness, and frequently
      displayed both tact and talent when left to their own resources, while
      many from whose high military rank and standing something like ability
      might have been looked for, proved the truism of the adage, that as &lsquo;the
      cowl does not make the monk,&rsquo; neither does an <i>aiguilette</i> constitute
      a general. Learning that some three hundred well-appointed rebels had
      assembled at Old Kilcullen, and that they had entrenched themselves in the
      churchyard, General Dundas proceeded to dislodge them. His force consisted
      of only forty dragoons and some twenty Suffolk militiamen. The rebel
      position was on a height&mdash;one side protected by a high wall, the
      other secured by a double fence&mdash;a hedge with a dike in front. Would
      it be credited that an English general could be mad enough to assail three
      hundred men thus posted with forty dragoons? Mus-grave thus narrates the
      transaction, and his account has been considered by those engaged to be
      perfectly correct:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      General Dundas ordered the Romneys and the 9th Dragoons to charge the
      rebels, though it was uphill, though the ground was broken, and many of
      the rebels were in a road close to the churchyard in which not more than
      six of the cavalry could advance in front.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They, however, charged with great spirit, though their destruction was
      considered by all the spectators to be the certain and inevitable
      consequence of it; for what could cavalry do, thus broken and divided,
      against a firm phalanx of rebels armed with long pikes? Nevertheless they
      made three charges, but were repulsed in each; and at every repulse the
      general urged them to renew the attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was with the utmost difficulty that Captain Cooks and Captain Erskine
      could prevail upon their men to renew the charge after the first defeat.
      In the last charge, Captain Cooks, to inspire his men with courage by
      example, advanced some yards before them; when his horse, having received
      many wounds, fell upon his knees; and while in that situation the body of
      that brave officer was perforated with pikes; and he, Captain Erskine, and
      twenty-two privates were killed on the spot, and ten so badly wounded that
      most of them died soon after.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Shamefully discomfited, Dundas fell back on the village of Kilcullen
      bridge, and occupied a pass in every way defensible. So thought the
      successful peasants who had garrisoned the churchyard and deforced an
      English general. They prudently declined any attempt to force the bridge,
      forded the Liffey at Castlemartin, and took up a position between Naas and
      Kilcullen&mdash;thus cutting off General Dundas&rsquo;s communication with the
      capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing remained for the royalist commander but to drive them from these
      grounds and open his road to Naas. He advanced accordingly, found them in
      line three deep, and with his cavalry in hand, boldly attacked the
      position with half a company of the gallant Suffolks. Small as the party
      was, three rounds broke the rebels. The cavalry charged, and the same body
      which had so recently inflicted a severe repulse were scattered like a
      flock of sheep, leaving the ground covered with their dead and wounded.
      After a brief but bloody pursuit, Dundas marched on Naas, to concentrate
      his troops and assist in covering the capital.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">ATTACK ON NAAS</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If one can imagine such a thing as a tableau, or bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the
      rebellion from the 23rd to the 30th of May (1790), the appearance it would
      present would be this. Seven or eight comparatively minor explosions,
      lighting up the atmosphere for a short space and then going gradually out,
      viz. one in Meath (Tara), one in Wicklow (Mount Kennedy), a good blaze in
      Carlow, and four or five in Kildare, which its being Lord Edward
      Fitzgerald&rsquo;s own county accounts for&mdash;these were Naas, Prosperous,
      Kilcullen, and Rathangan. The eye should then be drawn to the mighty and
      absorbing eruption of Wexford; taking Vinegar Hill as its crater, it would
      observe two streams of lava pouring forth, one due west to Ross, one due
      north towards Wicklow, and a third, of somewhat less importance,
      north-west to Newtown Barry. I rather think the first shot was fired by my
      regiment at Naas, as Mick Reynolds, who led the rebels, was one of the
      promptest of the insurgent leaders.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>The MS. Journal of a Field
      Officer</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The garrison of Naas consisted of a hundred and fifty of the Armagh
      Militia, with two battalion guns, and seventy cavalry, consisting of small
      detachments of the Fourth Dragoons, Ancient Britons, and sixteen mounted
      yeomen. The whole were under the command of Colonel Lord Gosford.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the general insurrection (the 23rd of May) anonymous
      letters were received by the commanding officer, apprising him that a
      night attack would be made upon the town by a numerous body of well-armed
      rebels, and necessary dispositions of the garrison were made to receive
      the threatened assault. The guards were doubled, the outskirts of the town
      carefully patrolled, and a plan of defence prearranged to prevent any
      confusion when the hour for action came. Midnight passed without anything
      occurring to cause alarm, and as morning dawned, it was believed that the
      information received the preceding evening had been incorrect, and the
      officers retired to their quarters. At half-past two, however, an outlying
      dragoon galloped in, announcing the advance of a numerous body of rebels;
      the drums beat to arms, and the garrison occupied their alarm posts.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps the commanding officer and his staff were more than a trifle
      incautious and premature in deciding there was nothing in the timely
      warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of the precautionary vigilance, Lord Gosford had the very
      narrowest possible escape from death by assassination. His lodging was
      situated at the summit of the hill which the Dublin road ascends. The
      sentinel at his door, having his attention attracted by the entrance of
      the rebel columns at the foot of the hill, was inexcusably so far off his
      guard as to allow two pikemen, belonging to the town, to slip into the
      hall, where they were ready to receive his lordship with their pikes as he
      hurried from his chamber on the alarm. And they were very near succeeding&mdash;but
      the sentinel turning about at the critical moment, shot one and bayoneted
      the other, just as his lordship was rushing down the stairs. The
      sentinel&rsquo;s name was John Sandford; he was afterwards made a sergeant, and
      his son a drummer.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebels, who had assembled at the quarries of Tipper, advanced on the
      town in four divisions, each entering by a different approach, and the
      heaviest column moving by the Johnstown Road. The latter was commanded by
      Michael Reynolds, and it made a bold effort to carry the jail, in front of
      which a party of the Armagh Militia, the Ancient Britons, and a battalion
      gun were posted. But the attack was completely repulsed, and the rebel
      loss would have been more considerable had not the cavalry, irritated by
      the fall of their officer, Captain Davis, who had been fatally piked,
      charged too prematurely, and interrupted the play of the gun; the
      execution of the latter was so trifling compared to what it should have
      produced upon a body in close column and at canister range, that it was
      ascribed rather to treachery than want of skill. For forty minutes,
      however, desultory firing continued.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Large parties of the rebels, who stole unnoticed into the town through
      the houses and narrow lanes, fought some time in the streets, and stood
      three volleys from the Armagh Militia, posted opposite to the barrack,
      before they gave way; at last they fled precipitately in every direction,
      when the cavalry charged, and killed a great number of them in the
      pursuit. Thirty of the rebels were killed in the streets; and from the
      numbers found dead in back houses and in the adjacent fields a few days
      afterwards, it is imagined that no less than three hundred must have
      fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They dropped in their flight a great quantity of pikes and other arms, of
      which a number were found in pits near the town, where also three men with
      green cockades were seized, and instantly hanged in the public streets.
      Another prisoner was spared in consequence of useful information which he
      gave. He informed the commanding officer that the rebel party was above
      one thousand strong, and was commanded by Michael Reynolds, who was well
      mounted, and dressed in yeoman uniform. He made his escape, but his horse
      fell into the hands of our troops.&rsquo;

      <span class="head">KILDARE AND CARLOW</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he entire of the
      county of Kildare was now in open insurrection, and not less than six
      rebel encampments were formed, and multitudes of the peasantry flocked to
      them. The houses were almost entirely deserted. Of the Protestant clergy
      not a man remained, and indeed the ferocity of party feeling had attained
      an intensity of violence which now can scarcely be imagined or believed.
      An infernal spirit actuated the opposite religionists. On one side,
      Catholics were too generally regarded with hatred and distrust; on the
      other, Protestants and Orangemen were held synonymous, and to all who
      dissented from the Church of Rome the most abominable feelings and
      intentions were attributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The MS. Journal of a Field Officer</i> relates: &lsquo;One of the <i>completest</i>
      things during the rebellion was the defeat of the rebels at Carlow, in
      which a company of my regiment had a share. There was full information of
      the intended attack, but &ldquo;not a drum was heard.&rdquo; The soldiers, who were
      chiefly in billets, were allowed to repair to their quarters as usual, and
      remain there until it was ascertained that the town rebels had quitted it
      to join their fellows and arm themselves, which they did about two miles
      from the town. A number of sergeants then went round, and the men were
      brought to their posts without the least alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rebel column entered Carlow by Tullow Street, unopposed&mdash;the
      street terminating in a place or open space where stood the horse barracks
      and jail. Arrived here they raised a loud shout or yell, and it was
      fearfully responded to by a destructive fire which opened upon them from
      different points. Seized with a panic at this unexpected reception they
      endeavoured to escape in various directions. The greater part retraced
      their steps through Tullow Street, but a picket had by this time occupied
      the further end of it, and opened a withering fire. They now sought refuge
      in the houses: these the soldiers set fire to; a number were shot in
      attempting to escape the flames, but a great many of the unfortunate
      wretches perished in them.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      About eighty houses were consumed in this conflagration; and for some days
      the roasted remains of unhappy men were falling down the chimneys in which
      they had perished.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be here necessary to mention that in Kildare, within a few days
      after the outbreak, an amnesty for the past was solicited by many of the
      rebels, and, with the consent of Government, the generals commanding in
      that county entered into negotiations with their chiefs. How far this was
      a prudent measure is questionable. In the spirit of the proclamations
      issued&mdash;with arms in their hands, rebels should have been placed
      outside the pale of treaty; while at the same time the most extensive
      forgiveness should have been extended to such as should disband themselves
      and reoccupy their abandoned dwellings. In diplomatic, as well as in field
      abilities, the royal generals were defective, and the amnesty produced
      nothing but treachery and bloodshed. The former charge rests with the
      insurgents, the latter must be laid at the hands of the royalists.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">TREACHERY IN THE MIDST OF THE CAPITAL</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile the counties
      in the immediate vicinity of the capital were thus in open insurrection,
      in the city the spirit and hopes of the disaffected were still buoyant as
      to the prospect of ultimate success; and although the failure of the 23rd
      had for a time paralysed the traitors of the metropolis, they were
      disappointed, but not despairing, and rebellion was &lsquo;scotched, not
      killed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The committees and &lsquo;directories&rsquo; continued their meetings, pikes were
      fabricated in large quantities, the sentries were assaulted on isolated
      posts, the doors of royalists were marked, domestic servants were
      corrupted. Musgrave records:&mdash;&lsquo;The Lord Mayor&rsquo;s servant acknowledged
      to his employer that he was at the head of a numerous body of servants who
      were to have assassinated their masters; that he and his party were to
      have murdered the Lord Mayor and his family, with two others of his
      servants who had refused to join this precious association, and that this
      atrocious deed was to have been the signal for the other servants in the
      vicinity to rise and commit similar enormities. Another certain proof that
      a revolution was not only contemplated but expected, many of the Dublin
      tradesmen refused to receive bank notes in payment from their customers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Another serious cause of alarm also was the discovery that into many of
      the yeomanry corps disaffected persons had been introduced, and in some
      the traitors outnumbered &lsquo;the true men.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In Kildare almost every corps was tainted, and the same remark applied to
      many in the metropolis. Of the country corps, the Sleamarigue laid down
      their arms, the Castledermot had but five well-affected men, the Athy
      cavalry were publicly disarmed in the market-place, and their captain,
      Fitzgerald of Geraldine, committed to prison. The Rathangan, North Naas,
      and Furnace yeomanry were all extensively disaffected, and the Clane,
      nominally amounting to sixty-six, could only muster five-and-twenty when
      the insurrection broke out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the metropolitan corps many were exclusively loyal, but others were not
      without traitorous members. One instance will be sufficient to show how
      extensive and dangerous was the disaffection.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 29th of May, the St. Sepulchre&rsquo;s corps, in turn of duty, took the
      guard at Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn, an outpost on the southwest side of the
      metropolis. While on the march to the bridge, a Roman Catholic yeoman,
      named Raymond, entered into conversation with his comrade, a notorious
      United Irishman, and communicated the secret plot. He told Jennings, &lsquo;that
      in case of an attack, which was hourly expected, and which it was believed
      he had previously concerted with the rebels, the disaffected members of
      the corps were to massacre their officers and the Protestants, and to
      deliver up the bridge to the assailants. They were then to proceed to the
      battery in the park, inform the guard that they had been defeated, ask
      admittance, and on being let in, murder the guard, take possession of the
      battery and ammunition, and turn it to their own use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Jennings had been sworn a United Irishman, and was attached to the cause
      from republican principles; but being a Protestant, and having discovered
      from the massacres which had taken place in the counties of Dublin, Meath,
      and Kildare, that the extirpation of his own order was intended, he
      informed Lieutenant Mathurin of the plot; and he, having communicated it
      to the Government, Raymond was taken up, tried, convicted, and hanged on
      the Old Bridge on the 1st of June.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Roman Catholic members of that corps, who formed the majority of
      it, were discovered to be disaffected, they were disarmed on parade the
      Sunday following, and disbanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fears of the inhabitants of the city were not abated when, on the 26th
      of May, the Lord Mayor caused the following placard to be circulated
      throughout the metropolis:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A Caution
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;<i>Lest the innocent should suffer for the guilty</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Lord Mayor requests his fellow-citizens to keep within their houses
      as much as they can, suitable to their convenience, after sunset, in this
      time of peril; as the streets should be kept as clear as possible, should
      any tumult or rising to support rebellion be attempted, in order that the
      troops and artillery may act with full effect in case of any disturbance.&rsquo; 
    </p>

      <span class="head">THE HILL OF TARA</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>t this period,
      after plundering, and a commission of other outrages at Dunboyn, the
      rebels, from the borders of Meath and Dublin, proceeded in the first
      instance to Dunshaughlin, and afterwards to the hill of Tara. Their
      numbers had rapidly increased; there were no military parties in the
      immediate neighbourhood; and unchecked and unresisted, they devastated the
      country for miles round their camp, to which they carried an immense
      quantity of booty. A few corps of yeomanry still remained in the vicinity,
      but they were not sufficiently numerous to attack a very strong and
      defensible position. Accident, however, interposed, and the royalists
      obtained the assistance they required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Three companies of the Reay Fencibles, with a battalion gun, were on the
      march to the metropolis, and halted in Navan on the night of the 25th of
      May. Captain Preston, who commanded the yeomanry of that town, solicited
      the co-operation of Captain M&rsquo;Clean to deforce the rebels....
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After going some time in quest of the rebels they found them very
      strongly posted on Tara hill, where they had been four hours, and about
      four thousand in number, while the country people were flocking to them in
      great multitudes from every quarter. They had plundered the houses in all
      the adjacent country of provisions of every kind, and were proceeding to
      cook their dinners, having lighted nearly forty fires, and hoisted white
      flags in their camp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The hill of Tara is very steep, and the upper part surrounded by three
      circular Danish forts, with ramparts and fosses; while on the top lies the
      churchyard surrounded with a wall, which the rebels regarded as their
      citadel, and considered impregnable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The king&rsquo;s troops, including the yeomanry, might have amounted to about
      four hundred. As soon as the rebels perceived them they put their hats on
      the tops of their spikes, sent forth some dreadful yells, and at the same
      time began to jump, and put themselves in singular attitudes, as if
      bidding defiance to their adversaries. They then began to advance, firing
      at the same time, but in an irregular manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our line of infantry came on with the greatest coolness, and did not fire
      a shot until they were within fifty yards. One part of the cavalry,
      commanded by Lord Fingal, was ordered to the right, the other to the left,
      to prevent the line from being outflanked, which the enemy attempted to
      accomplish. The rebels made three desperate onsets, and in the last laid
      hold of the cannon; but the officer who commanded the gun laid the match
      to it before they could completely surround it, prostrated ten or twelve
      of the assailants, and dispersed the remainder. The Reay Fencibles
      preserved their line, and fired with as much coolness as if they had been
      exercising on a field-day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At length they routed the rebels, who fled in all directions, having lost
      about four hundred in killed and wounded. In their flight they threw away
      arms and ammunition, and everything that could encumber them. Three
      hundred horses, all their provisions, arms, ammunition, and baggage fell
      into the hands of the victors, with eight of the Reay Fencibles, whom they
      had taken prisoners two days before, and whom they employed to drill them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is to be lamented that the Reay Fencibles lost twenty-six men in
      killed and wounded, and the Upper Kells infantry six men.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The king&rsquo;s troops would have remained on the field all night, but they
      had not a cartridge left either for the gun or small arms, The prisoners,
      of whom they took a good many, informed our officers that their intention
      was to have proceeded that night to plunder Navan, and then Kells, where
      there was a great quantity of ammunition, and little or no force to
      protect it; and that when they had succeeded they expected, according to a
      preconcerted plan, to have been joined by a great number of insurgents
      from Meath, Westmeath, Lough, Monaghan, and Cavan.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The defeat of the insurgents, and their complete dispersion at Tara hill
      and on the Curragh, were highly advantageous, as they opened the
      communications north and south with the metropolis, which had been
      seriously interrupted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many partial affairs took place at this time between the royalists and the
      rebels in Kildare, and barbarities on the one side produced on the other a
      terrible retaliation. The insurgents burned and murdered as they went
      along; the troops and yeomen shot and hanged liberally in return. The
      record of crimes inhumanly committed and ruthlessly revenged would only
      disgust a reader.
    </p>
    <p>
      While thus Kildare was exhibited for nearly a week one wide blaze of
      general insurrection, another county, which in the annals of rebellion
      assumed afterwards a sanguinary pre-eminence, remained in ominous
      tranquillity. The storm burst at last, and in crime and bloodshed Wexford
      left every other scene of tumultuary violence completely in the shade.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">WEXFORD INSURRECTION AND CONSEQUENT ATROCITIES</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>exford had long
      withstood the anarchy of the evil days. While many counties in Ireland
      were disgraced by nocturnal robbery and assassination, committed by
      Defenders and United Irishmen, for five years previous to &lsquo;97, it was the
      pride of the Wexford gentlemen to boast that their county had remained in
      perfect tranquillity. But in the autumn and winter of that year, and in
      the spring of &lsquo;98, there were well-grounded suspicions that the mass of
      the people had begun to be infected by those baneful principles which
      since proved fatal to the kingdom, that pikes were manufactured, and clubs
      had been formed, in which illegal oaths had been administered. In April,
      however, unequivocal symptoms that a disaffected spirit actuated the
      peasantry became evident; and although the priests laboured hard to lead
      the resident gentry to believe that no danger was impending, and the
      people by thousands swore allegiance in the chapels, and expressed open
      attachment to the Government, there is too much reason to conclude that
      the plot had been long in preparation, and that the ferocious spirit which
      marked the proceedings of the insurgents was not the wild ebullition of a
      resentment produced by injudicious severity, but the fruits of a
      long-cherished antipathy to those who dissented from them in faith. It was
      the explosion of a frantic effort of the Papists to stamp out and
      exterminate their Protestant fellow-countrymen.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no doubt violent measures produced great exasperation, and that
      possibly a conciliatory policy might have averted the outbreak altogether.
      &lsquo;Not above six hundred men at most of the regular army or militia were
      stationed in the county, the defence of which was almost abandoned to the
      troops of yeomen and their supplementaries. The magistrates in several
      districts employed themselves in ordering the seizure, imprisonment, and
      whipping of numbers of suspected persons. These yeomen being Protestants,
      prejudiced against the Romanists by traditionary and other accounts of the
      former cruelties that sect committed, fearing similar cruelties in case of
      insurrection, and confirmed in this fear by papers found in the pockets of
      some prisoners, containing the old sanguinary doctrines of the Romish
      Church, which authorised the extermination of heretics, acted with a
      spirit ill-fitted to allay religious hatred and prevent any feeling to
      rebels.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">CAPTAIN FATHER JOHN MURPHY OF BOULAVOGUE</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">U</span>ntil Saturday, the
      26th of May, the flame of rebellion remained smouldering; but on that
      evening John Murphy, the curate or coadjutor-priest of Boulavogue, gave
      the signal for a general rising, which was too fatally responded to. A
      fire lighted on the hill of Corrigrua was answered by another kindled on
      Boulavogue, and the rapidity with which the volcano burst appears almost
      incredible. Murphy, the rebel general, was the son of a petty farmer in
      the parish of Ferns, where he was educated at a hedge school kept by a man
      of the name of Gun. It appears by his testimonium and diploma, that he
      received holy orders at Seville in Spain in the year 1785, and probably
      graduated there as a doctor of divinity, as he assumes that title in his
      journal, which was dropped in his retreat from Vinegar Hill, and found by
      Captain Hugh Moore of the 5th Dragoons, aide-de-camp to General Needham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nothing could be more ferocious than the church-militant career of this
      savage man. Every Protestant house in the parish of Kilcormick was reduced
      to ashes, and such of their unfortunate owners as could be seized were
      ruthlessly destroyed. These outrages proceeded entirely from a truculent
      disposition&mdash;for mostly his victims were men who offered no
      opposition&mdash;and when rashly attacked at a place called the Harrow, he
      beat off the Camolin cavalry, and killed Lieutenant Bookey who commanded
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whether the demon spirit which Murphy afterwards exhibited had been
      provoked or not is a matter of controversy; some say that his house and
      chapel had been burnt before he took the field, and others as positively
      deny it. In searching through the evidence on record dispassionately, I
      incline to the Tatter opinion, for when his house was burned the furniture
      had been previously removed and hidden in a sand-pit, and when his
      vestments were brought from the same concealment, the leader of the
      loyalists observed, in reply to some insulting remark, &lsquo;Punish the rebel
      if you can, but offer no mockery to his religion.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in his martial career Murphy commenced his murderous treacheries,
      destroying the glebe house at Kyle and murdering the rector of
      Kilmuckridge, Doctor Burrowes, and his family, under circumstances of
      peculiar atrocity. The house was defended with barricades by the rector
      and his parishioners at sunrise it was attacked by about five hundred
      rebels. &lsquo;It was vigorously defended for some time, many shots having been
      fired by the assailants and the besieged. At last the rebels set fire to
      the out-offices, which were quickly consumed, and soon after to the
      dwelling-house, which in a short time was in a state of conflagration. The
      rapid spread of the flames in the latter was caused by the application of
      some unctuous combustible matter applied to the doors and windows of the
      house, which the rebels frequently used in the course of the rebellion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The besieged being in danger of suffocation from the thickness of the
      smoke, resolved to quit the house, however perilous it might be, and this
      they were encouraged to do by Father Murphy, who assured them they should
      not be injured if they surrendered themselves without further resistance.
      Relying on his promise they quitted the house, on which the rebels
      treacherously murdered Mr. Burrowes and seven of his parishioners, and
      gave his son, a youth of sixteen, so severe a wound in the belly with a
      pike, that it subsequently caused his death.

      has seized this characteristic incident for one of his graphic pictures.
      It will be remembered that Murphy&rsquo;s father came from the parish of Ferns.
      The illustration is in itself sufficiently graphic, and filled with
      pictorial details descriptive of the incident. Maxwell has related, in
      reference to the plunder of the bishop&rsquo;s palace, an anecdote connected
      with it, which marks the total subversion of principle, religious
      feelings, badly excited, will produce. An orphan boy, whom the bishop had
      found naked and starving at the age of seven years, and whom he had fed,
      clothed, and instructed afterwards, was the leader of these marauders,
      showed them every valuable article of furniture, and assisted them in
      breaking open the cellar. The bishop&rsquo;s fine library was plundered of its
      antique folios; these the rebels converted into saddles.

    <p>
      Both camps were attacked, but with results painfully different. The
      garrison of the little town of Carnew, consisting of nearly three hundred
      yeomanry, mounted and dismounted, marched boldly against the insurgents
      collected on Kilthomas, roughly estimated at about three thousand men.
      Although, with favourable ground and enormous superiority of numbers, it
      might have been expected that an attempt to dislodge the rebels from their
      position would have failed, nothing could have been more successful than
      the attack, and the royalists obtained a bloodless victory. Here again,
      the unrelenting spirit of the times appeared, and a very gallant and
      daring exploit was sullied by impolitic severity. The attempt to disperse
      the second camp at Oulart was attended with consequences not only
      disastrous to the troops engaged, but its results caused afterwards an
      immensity of bloodshed. Through the imprudence of an incompetent
      commanding officer, a very gallant detachment perished, while the
      insurgents, encouraged by accidental success, acquired a false but
      dangerous confidence which involved a fearful amount of atrocity, with a
      reaction, in many cases to be excused, and in more to be lamented.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the 27th of May, Mr. Turner of Newfort arrived at
      Wexford and announced that his own house had been attacked and robbed of a
      quantity of arms, previously surrendered, and that the insurrection had
      unequivocally broken out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Intelligence presently came in of the murders and atrocities everywhere
      committed in the neighbourhood, and also of the formation of a rebel camp
      at Oulart. Thinking it advisable to crush the outbreak in its birth, the
      yeomanry cavalry proceeded to scour the country, while Captain Foote with
      a detachment of the North Cork militia, amounting to no men, rank and
      file, marched in the direction of the rebel camp; and in route to Oulart
      he was joined by a troop of yeomanry cavalry; however, most of the yeomen
      in face of the enemy proved traitors and deserted to the enemy. In rough
      numbers, the insurgent force might have been set down at four to five
      thousand combatants. Although the advance was made with every disregard of
      military caution, accident more than determination enabled the rebels to
      profit from the gross mismanagement of the force opposed to them. Contempt
      of an enemy, which creates incaution, has often proved fatal. The rebels
      fled at the first onset, and were pursued at full speed by the militia,
      who were so little apprehensive of resistance, that no rank or order was
      observed. While the rebels were making their escape with precipitation
      towards the northern side of the hill, they were apprised that a large
      body of cavalry had been seen that morning advancing against them in the
      opposite direction, apparently with a design to intercept their flight and
      co-operate with the militia by a double attack. As the Wexfordian
      insurgents as yet were totally unacquainted with warfare, the onset of
      cavalry was, to the imaginations of many among them, more terrible than
      that of infantry. They therefore ignorantly supposed the cavalry to be
      still in the neighbourhood; and while Father John Murphy exclaimed that
      they must either conquer or perish, they turned desperately against the
      militia, who had now arrived near the summit, almost breathless, and
      charging them with their pikes, killed the whole detachment in an instant,
      except the lieutenant-colonel, a sergeant, and three privates. &lsquo;It
      appears,&rsquo; says Musgrave, &lsquo;that the rebels were rendered bold and desperate
      by intoxication, and that from twelve to fifteen of them singled out, cut
      off, and attacked each of the soldiers, who did not resign their lives but
      at a dear rate to their assailants.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The consequences of this unfortunate disaster speedily evinced themselves.
      Numbers of the peasantry who had hitherto remained neutral repaired to the
      camp and joined the rebel standard; and in the same ratio that the
      confidence of the insurgents increased, the spirit of the royalists was
      abated. Fearful of an attack by numbers of savage men under the
      intoxication of a first success, the little garrison of Gorey determined
      to retreat at once on Arklow; and the movement was conceived and executed
      with a celerity that caused the most afflicting distress to crowds of
      helpless loyalists, who, dreading the ferocity of the rebels, abandoned
      their homes and followed the retiring garrison as they best could; the
      situation of these unfortunates was truly deplorable, and their subsequent
      sufferings pitiable in the extreme.

    <p>
      <span class="head">DESTRUCTION OF THE CHURCH AT ENNISCORTHY</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>lushed with
      success, Murphy, the fighting priest of Boulavogue, now turned his
      attention to the town of Enniscorthy, six miles distant from his
      encampment. Its possession would be important; and as the garrison
      amounted only to about three hundred men, of whom a hundred were North
      Cork Militia and the remainder local yeomanry, there was every reason to
      believe that an open town, accessible in many quarters and protected by a
      feeble garrison, would offer to the overwhelming masses which should
      assail it a short and unavailing defence. Accordingly, Father Murphy
      determined to attack the place, and he carried his resolution into effect
      early on the afternoon of the 28th of May.
    </p>
    <p>
      From its dangerous vicinity to the rebel encampment the garrison of the
      town apprehended, naturally enough, that the first effort of the
      victorious insurgents would be directed against them, and they were
      obliged, in consequence, to be vigilant and prepared. The duty of
      patrolling and giving pickets was therefore most harassing; for three days
      and nights they had been continually under arms; but though worn out and
      exhausted, while reports and appearances were most discouraging, they
      determined nevertheless to offer a gallant defence, and nobly they
      realised their resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Certain intelligence having been received on the morning of the 28th that
      the town would be attacked early that afternoon, the drums beat to arms
      and the garrison took the posts previously assigned to them. The North
      Cork Militia occupied the bridge, a cavalry corps holding the street
      connecting it with the town, while the Duffry gate hill, upon the Carlow
      road, was protected by the yeomanry and infantry. The market-house and
      castle had each a sergeant&rsquo;s guard allotted for its defence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The ground taken up by the yeomanry was three or four hundred yards in
      front of the Duffry gate, and on that point the rebels made their opening
      attack. On perceiving the yeomanry in line, the insurgent column halted
      and deployed, extending largely to the right and left, to outflank the
      small body in their front and cut it from the town. This done, they
      advanced, driving cattle in their front, and at the same time opening a
      heavy and well-directed fire. (As the county of Wexford abounds with
      water-fowl, the occupation of a fowler is so profitable that numbers of
      the lower class of people are not only experts in the use of fire-arms,
      but excellent marksmen.) The yeomanry replied to it with effect, but
      dreading, from the extension of the rebel wings, that they should be
      ultimately turned, they retired into the town, covered by a charge of
      cavalry, which dispersed a body that pressed them too closely, but
      inflicted on the gallant horsemen a very heavy loss.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suburbs and the town itself were now on fire. A number of the
      assailants had got in through by-ways unperceived, the rebel inhabitants
      fired on the royalists from their windows (many lives of officers were
      thus picked off in ambuscade), while, repulsed from an attempt upon the
      bridge, the insurgents attempted to ford the river beyond the reach of the
      fire of the North Cork Militia. Pressed by numbers totally
      disproportionate, the yeomanry obstinately held their ground, and although
      suffering heavily themselves, they cheered as they observed that their own
      heavy and well-supported fusilade cut down the head of the rebel column
      and checked its advance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The streets,&rsquo; relates Musgrave, &lsquo;were entirely involved in smoke, so that
      the yeomen could not perceive the rebels till they were charged by their
      pikes. The flames from the houses at each side of the street were so great
      as to unite and form a fiery arch, by which their hair was singed and the
      bear-skin in their caps was burnt. The loyalists, bravely disputing every
      inch of ground, retreated to the market-house, an open space like a
      square, where they made a determined stand and killed great numbers of the
      enemy. By this effort the loyalists turned the scale and drove the rebels
      completely out of the town, the streets of which at each side of the river
      presented an awful scene of conflagration. While the troops were thus
      engaged in the south side of the town, another body of the rebels crossed
      the river, about three-quarters of a mile above the bridge, but were soon
      routed by Captain Snowe. On this occasion his men showed great dexterity
      as marksmen, seldom failing to bring down such individual rebels as they
      aimed at. Captain Snowe then ordered Captain Richards to charge, which he
      did most effectually, but with heavy loss in killed and wounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As a party of the rebels, which came from Vinegar Hill towards the glebe,
      still remained unassailed and their numbers seemed increasing, they were
      attacked by Captain Drury, with half a company of the North Cork Militia,
      and dispersed with considerable slaughter.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus ended an action which lasted more than three hours, fought on a very
      hot day, in the midst of a burning town, the disaffected inhabitants of
      which set fire to their own houses to annoy the loyalists, and fired on
      them from their windows with deadly effect, picking out the loyalist
      leaders. In this action the yeomen and Protestant inhabitants performed
      prodigies of valour in support of the constitution and in defence of their
      property and their families.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was generally believed that not less than five hundred of the rebels
      were killed or wounded. The banks of the river and the island in it were
      strewed with their dead bodies, and numbers of them fell in the streets.
      To keep up the courage of the insurgents every artifice was used; for even
      women, as if insensible of danger, were seen in the midst of the carnage
      administering whiskey to their rebel friends.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In this most gallant defence the loss sustained by the garrison fell
      chiefly on the yeomanry and loyalists; nearly a third of the whole amount
      employed were placed <i>hors de combat</i>, the greater proportion being
      slain.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the rebels were repulsed, the necessity of an instant retreat became
      apparent. The town was on fire, and no longer tenable by a garrison
      equally reduced in strength and numbers, the insurgents were hanging in an
      immense force about the town, a night attack seemed almost certain, and no
      hope could be held out that under existing circumstances it could be
      repulsed. A council of war was held, and, after mature deliberation, it
      was resolved to abandon the town and march on Wexford by the eastern side
      of the river, by St. John&rsquo;s. &lsquo;From the suddenness of the retreat, only a
      few of the Protestant inhabitants could accompany the troops, and they
      could carry with them no other comforts or necessaries but the apparel
      which they wore. Imagination cannot form a more tragic scene than the
      melancholy train of fugitives, of whom some were so helpless from their
      wounds, from sickness, the feebleness of old age or infancy, that they
      could not have effected their escape had not the yeomen cavalry mounted
      them on their horses. Some parents were reduced to the dreadful necessity
      of leaving their infants in cottages on the roadside, with but faint hope
      of ever seeing them again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The town, the morning after the rebels got possession of it, presented a
      dreadful scene of carnage and conflagration; many bodies were lying dead
      in the streets, and others groaning in the agonies of death; some parts of
      the place were entirely consumed, and in others the flames continued to
      rage with inextinguishable fury. No less than 478 dwelling-houses and
      cabins were burned in the town and its suburbs, besides a great number of
      stores, malt-houses, and out-offices.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebel entrance of the town was marked by the atrocities of a barbarous
      force, irritated by resistance, and now excited by the accidental success
      which circumstances had given them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">AN ACT OF VENGEANCE</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      In the spirit of sheer destructiveness the rebels turned their exertions
      to wrecking the Protestant church. Our artist has graphically pictured the
      wild and lurid spectacle attending the wilful destruction of the church at
      Enniscorthy; vestments, benches, the organ, the pulpit, Bibles, and church
      furniture were devoted to feed the flames and make a bonfire; meanwhile
      the triumphant insurgents are shown carrying off the church bell as a
      trophy, which we find set up subsequently, a prominent feature of the vast
      rebel camp in the vicinity.

      <span class="head">THE CAMP ON VINEGAR HILL</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>mmediately after
      obtaining possession of Enniscorthy the rebels proceeded to form an
      extensive encampment on Vinegar Hill, from which the town, after its
      seizure, was garrisoned by rebel reliefs, sent down from headquarters on
      the mountain. Immense numbers of the peasantry flocked to this camp, and
      in a few days it was believed that fully ten thousand men were there
      collected. As this was the point on which the insurgents concentrated in
      greater force and for a longer time than on any other during the brief
      period that elapsed from the <i>émeute</i> to its final suppression, and
      as it was also, unhappily, the scene, were its atrocities recorded, that
      would picture civil war in revolting colours&mdash;which may be fancied
      but not detailed&mdash;it may be interesting here to describe its local
      position and the appearance it then presented.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a military point of view Vinegar Hill is strong. High grounds,
      gradually rising, are crowned by a cone of bold ascent, while the country
      beneath, being cultivated fields, is divided into numerous enclosures, and
      intersected by stone walls, hedges, and trenches. On the apex of the hill
      stood the ruins of a windmill; round the upper height some rude
      field-works were thrown up, as well as on a lower ridge which the rebels
      occupied as part of their position. For defence by irregular troops, who
      trusted rather to numbers than to discipline, Vinegar Hill was
      particularly favourable, for the numerous enclosures afforded safe cover
      for skirmishers, who could with perfect impunity severely annoy any
      columns advancing to assail the hill, and oblige an enemy to feel his way
      with caution. Good roads wound round the base of the position, and a
      command of the Slaney added to its military value.
    </p>
    <p>
      Its local appearance was singular and picturesque, and perfectly in
      keeping with a wild and guerilla sort of warfare. Although the weather was
      particularly hot and night but nominal, a part of the insurgents placed
      themselves under cover, and the position exhibited rather the varied
      colouring of an Indian camp than the dazzling whiteness of &lsquo;the tented
      field.&rsquo; Wattles&mdash;as thin and flexible poles are termed in Irish
      parlance&mdash;were overhung with blankets, tablecloths, chintz furniture,
      and window curtains, plundered from the surrounding neighbourhood, while
      in the centre, from the top of the ruined windmill, a green flag &lsquo;dared
      the battle and the breeze.&rsquo; A few guns and swivels were rudely placed in
      battery, and in whatever else the rebel executive might have been
      deficient, their commissariat, as the figures and records show, was
      carefully attended to. A local board of field officers assembled every
      day, and after their deliberations the larders and cellars of the
      neighbouring gentry were put into extensive requisition. Vinegar Hill was
      better provided with rude accommodations than any of the insurgent
      stations, for the heights on which the rebel masses herded were generally
      mere bivouacs, hurriedly taken up and as suddenly abandoned. These posts
      they termed camps, though they were destitute of tents, except a few for
      their chiefs, while the people remained in the open air in vast
      multitudes, men and women promiscuously, some lying covered with blankets
      at night, and some without other covering than the clothes which they wore
      during the day. This mode of warfare was favoured by an uninterrupted
      continuance of dry and warm weather, to such a length of time as is very
      unusual in Ireland in that season, or any season of the year. This was
      regarded by the rebels as a particular interposition of Providence in
      their favour, and some among them are said to have declared, in a
      prophetic tone, that not a drop of rain was to fall until they should be
      masters of all Ireland. On the other hand, the same was considered by the
      fugitive loyalists as a merciful favour of Heaven, since bad weather must
      have miserably augmented their distress and caused the death of many. In
      these encampments or stations, among such crowds of riotous, undisciplined
      men, under no regular authority, the greatest disorder may be supposed to
      have prevailed. Often when a rebel was in a sound sleep in the night he
      was robbed by some associate of his gun or some article considered
      valuable; and hence to sleep flat on the belly, with the hat and shoes
      tied under the breast for the prevention of stealth, was the general
      custom.

      <span class="head">THE CAMP ON VINEGAR HILL</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The camp at Vinegar Hill presented a dreadful scene of confusion and
      uproar. A number of female rebels, more vehement than the male, were
      marching out to meet the army from Newtown Barry; this was a large body
      which Father Roche led from Vinegar Hill to the attack of that town, which
      took place the 1st of June. Great numbers of women were in the camp. Some
      men were employed in killing cattle and in boiling them in pieces in large
      copper brewing-pans; others were drinking, cursing, and swearing; many of
      them were playing on various musical instruments which they had acquired
      by plunder in the adjacent Protestant houses, the whole producing a most
      disagreeable and barbarous dissonance.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Visit to the Camp,
      Rossiters Affidavit</i>, printed in Musgrave&rsquo;s <i>Appendix</i>, No. XX.
    </p>
    <p>
      They were in nothing more irregular than in the cooking of provisions,
      many of them cutting pieces at random out of cattle scarcely dead without
      waiting to dismember them, and roasting those pieces on the points of
      their pikes, with the parts of the hide which belonged to them still
      attached. The heads of cattle were seldom eaten, but generally left to rot
      on the surface of the ground, as were often large portions of the carcases
      after a few pieces had been cut away. From this practice the decay of
      animal matter was rapid, and the stench of the encampment in a few days
      became intolerable.

      <span class="head">THE FATAL PASS OF TUBBERNEERING</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>his incident, one
      of the most fatal episodes of the insurrection, was due, like several
      others recounted, to the incompetence of the leaders; a fine body of men
      were thus sacrificed, and the situation of the loyalists was aggravated in
      consequence. The abandonment of Wexford followed the succession of
      military mistakes. The peasantry, hounded on by truculent priests and
      ferocious partisans, committed every enormity which can be imagined, while
      the royalists and yeomanry emulated this abominable cruelty, and, under
      the name of loyalty, too frequently perpetrated wanton and savage
      reprisals. Confidence between men was ended, and while the rebels
      dissimulated to obtain their end, the royalist, shielded by the hand of
      power still predominant, robbed and slaughtered &lsquo;in the king&rsquo;s name.&rsquo; On
      both sides there were violence and treachery. It was an unholy contest,
      and while Popish massacres were revolting, it cannot be denied that
      Protestant atrocities were neither &lsquo;few nor far between.&rsquo; Colonel Walpole
      was detached from Dublin to reinforce General Loftus, that on his junction
      he arrogated for himself an independent command, that it was culpably
      acceded to, that he was ambitious to fight an action without delay, and
      that to oblige a minion of a Lord-Lieutenant an attack on the rebel
      position, the hill of Ballymore, was planned, it being considered the
      safest method of gratifying &lsquo;a carpet-knight&rsquo; whose services had as vet
      been confined to the duties of the drawing-room. The result may be
      imagined. Walpole led his fine division into a well-prepared ambuscade in
      the fatal pass of Tubberneering, the guns were taken, the commanders shot.
      &lsquo;Suddenly from the enclosures a wild yell burst forth, accompanied by a
      stream of musketry. Colonel Walpole fell on the first fire; the confusion
      was tremendous, and to fight or retreat impossible. The height and number
      of the fences on every side made the ground most favourable for irregular
      and desultory warfare, as the long pikes of the rebels reached nearly
      across the narrow road, and those of the distracted soldiers who escaped
      the first close fire were perforated from behind the hedges&rsquo; by invisible
      opponents. The surprise of the troops was complete, dragoons and infantry
      were thrown in helpless disorder on each other, and a scene of butchery
      ensued. The column was now completely surrounded, discipline unavailing;
      an attempt made by a detachment of the 4th Dragoon Guards to turn the
      enemy&rsquo;s right flank failed. After having sustained the attack for about
      three-quarters of an hour with considerable disadvantage on the part of
      the king&rsquo;s troops, and having lost their commander and three pieces of
      artillery, which were immediately turned against them, a retreat began in
      all the confusion which might be expected from raw and inexperienced
      troops.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The rebels pressed them hard, a general dismay took place, which would
      probably have been fatal to the whole of the column had not
      Lieutenant-Colonel Cope of the Armagh Militia, who had been fortunately in
      the rear of the column with a detachment of his own regiment, rallied and
      formed them on the road to impede the progress of the enemy. He gallantly
      disputed every inch of it for three miles. To this small band of brave
      men, under the command of a cool and gallant officer, the safety of those
      who escaped on that disastrous day may be entirely attributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Walpole, a mere Castle <i>attache</i>, had been very improperly employed
      to collect what troops could be spared from Naas, Kilcullen, and
      Baltinglas to reinforce General Loftus.... Walpole assumed the duties of
      his superior, planned ridiculous attacks, and finally sacrificed one of
      the finest detachments in the field.&rsquo;

      related the touching incident of which George Cruikshank has made an
      effective picture:&mdash;&lsquo;A drummer, named Hunter, of the Antrim regiment,
      only some twelve years old, fell into the hands of the rebels in the
      unfortunate affair in which Colonel Walpole lost his life. He carried his
      drum with him, and when conducted to the town of Gorey with some other
      prisoners, being ordered to beat it, actuated by a spirit of enthusiastic
      loyalty, he exclaimed, &ldquo;That the King&rsquo;s drum should never be beaten for
      rebels,&rdquo; and at the same instant leaped on the head and broke through the
      parchment. The inhuman villains, callous to admiration of an heroic act
      even in an enemy, instantly perforated his body with pikes.&rsquo;

      The consequences of the slaughter at Tubberneering were precisely such as
      might be expected. The royalists lost heart, and the insurgents acquired a
      dangerous audacity. Every Protestant abandoned home and property in
      despair, and more than a thousand individuals fled from their once happy
      dwellings, with wives and children, and, without food or shelter,
      endeavoured to seek safety elsewhere, and obtain eleemosynary support from
      those who still possessed a home. In the first place all, soldiers and
      civilians alike, fell back to Arklow, but, feeling themselves insecure
      even there, the retreat was continued to Wicklow.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we have seen, the results of the insurgent success reacted most
      disastrously; the rebels at once became masters of Gorey, and to the army
      of Irish liberty in &lsquo;98 the conquest of this town proved the reverse of
      advantageous to the captors.

      been a matter of little import, but unhappily the contest had now taken a
      religious colouring, so rancorous and sanguinary that blood alone could

      <i>The MS. Journal of a Field Officer</i>, in every sense an invaluable
      guide to the true situation of those affairs which come within the
      observations of this keen professional critic, dwells conclusively on this
      point: &lsquo;Providentially, the rebels had too many commanders; those of the
      Wexford force being mostly priests, their attention was more directed to
      the interests of their church by purging the land of heretics than to the
      concerns of the &ldquo;Irish Republic,&rdquo; which the northern leaders had in view.
      Consequently time was wasted in collecting and piking Protestants, which
      might have been employed with far greater advantage to the cause.&rsquo;

      <span class="head">THE BATTLE OF ROSS</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he operations of
      the rebel armies which we have already detailed, namely, the attempt on
      Newtown Barry by the corps under Father Kearns, and that on Gorey by the
      insurgents under the two Murphys and Perry of Inch, with the intervening
      occurrence of Walpole&rsquo;s defeat at Tubberneering, must be connected by a
      simultaneous transaction, probably, in military importance, the most
      interesting which marked the outbreak.
    </p>
    <p>
      The strongest of the insurgent corps had assembled on the hill of
      Carrickbyrne, under the chief command of B. Baganel Harvey, with Father
      Roche acting en second. Their encampment was six miles from the town of
      Ross, of which it was their first and greatest object to obtain
      possession.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dangerous proximity of the rebel host had caused alarm for the safety
      of the town, and, consequently, the garrison had been strengthened. On the
      5th of June the County Dublin Militia, commanded by the popularly beloved
      Lord Mountjoy, with detachments from the Clare, Donegal, and Meath
      Militia, 5th Dragoons, Midlothian Fencibles, and English Artillery,
      occupied the place&mdash;a force amounting to 1400 men of all arms, of
      which 150 were yeomen. General Johnson, a veteran officer, commanded, and
      his heroic exertions won the day, and must shed a lasting lustre upon his
      reputation as a courageous and able leader.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the evening of the 4th June the rebel camp at Carrick-byrne broke up,
      and the insurgents moved bodily to Corbethill, within a mile and a half of
      Ross. The rebel hordes &lsquo;moved by parishes and baronies, each having a
      particular standard; in their way they stopped at a chapel, where mass was
      said at the head of each column by priests, who sprinkled an abundance of
      holy water on them.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Musgrave</i>. After driving in a distant
      outpost they bivouacked on Corbethill for the night. The royalists,
      fearing a surprise, remained under arms, the infantry and guns in position
      on the southern and eastern faces of the town, the yeoman infantry holding
      the bridge, and the cavalry formed on the quay. Night passed, however,
      without alarm; and it was four o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 5th before
      Baganel Harvey, who had been a few days before elected to the chief
      command, sent a formal summons to General Johnson, which unfortunately (as
      some say) was not delivered. Furlong, the rebel leader, who carried it,
      was shot, through the ignorance of the advanced sentry, who paid no
      respect to a white handkerchief he waved on approaching the outposts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>The MS. Journal of a Field Officer</i> sums up the actual military
      situation: &lsquo;The movement upon Ross showed some head on the part of Baganel
      Harvey, the object being to force the principal passage of the Barrow,
      and, in conjunction with the insurgents of Kilkenny, bear down upon
      Waterford, which was then very disaffected, weakly garrisoned, and
      presented strong temptations in the way of plunder. But Harvey had no idea
      of attacking Ross when that event took place, and there were evidently no
      preparations made for it. Harvey expected, and with reason, that the
      appearance of his masses on the hills which domineered the town would have
      secured the active co-operation of the Kilkenny men from the other side of
      the Barrow. And this would have been the case had time allowed it, but
      Furlong was a popular leader among the rebels, and when he was shot by a
      sentinel at the outpost the mass of the rebels, maddened by the
      occurrence, rushed by a sudden impulse, in a mighty but disordered
      torrent, along one side of the road on the Three-bullet Gate, instead of
      making a combined movement on an open town, by which facility of approach
      and enormous preponderance in numbers could not but have succeeded.&rsquo; This
      argument is supported by the communication which Furlong carried. On
      searching the pockets of the dead man the following cartel was found:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir&mdash;As a friend to humanity I request you will surrender the town of
      Ross to the Wexford forces, now assembled against that town. Your
      resistance will but provoke rapine and plunder, to the ruin of the most
      innocent. Flushed with victory, the Wexford forces, now innumerable and
      irresistible, will not be controlled if they meet with resistance. To
      prevent, therefore, the total ruin of all property in the town I urge you
      to a speedy surrender, which you will be forced to in a few hours, with
      loss and bloodshed, as you are surrounded on all sides. Your answer is
      required in four hours. Mr. Furlong carries this letter, and will bring
      the answer.&mdash;I am, Sir,
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      Camp at Corbethill, half-past three o&rsquo;clock morning,
    </p>
    <p>
      June 5, 1798.
    </p>
    <p>
      The death of Furlong is said to have precipitated the attack, for
      immediately afterwards the rebels moved forward in dense masses, cheering
      and yelling, and directing their march on the Three-bullet Gate. The
      advance of this armed multitude&mdash;by some estimated as from 20,000 to
      25,000 men&mdash;was described to me by an eye-witness as the most
      singular spectacle imaginable. The irregularity of their array&mdash;partly
      in close column and partly in line&mdash;had the effect of displaying
      their enormous strength to full advantage; while the presence of several
      priests, who were observed flitting through their ranks and haranguing
      their deluded followers with certain assurances of victory, inspired an
      enthusiastic fanaticism, which blinded them to danger and rendered them
      additionally formidable. They pushed forward four guns and a cloud of
      musketeers, some in extended order, and others heading the pikemen, whose
      crowded columns occupied the whole road, far as the eye could range.
    </p>
    <p>
      As might have been expected, the pickets were roughly driven in, and, in a
      wild rush made by the rebels on the troops in front of the Three-bullet
      Gate, the latter were obliged to recede, and one of the guns was captured.
      In turn, however, the troops rallied and drove back the insurgents, and,
      perceiving their unsteadiness when mobbed together in the repulse, General
      Johnson ordered the 5th Dragoons to charge. For cavalry effect the ground
      was totally <i>un suite</i>, the numerous fences enabling the rebels to
      avoid the charge, while, protected themselves, they inflicted a heavy loss
      on men who very gallantly, but very ineffectively, had thus assailed them
      at disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      An entrance to the town was gained, and while some of the rebels fired the
      houses, others pushed forward towards the bridge. But the advance by
      Neville Street was swept by the steady fire of a gun placed in the
      market-place, which looked directly down the approach. Notwithstanding the
      murderous fire which fell on a dense mass of men, wedged together in a
      narrow street, and which shore the head of the column down as frequently
      as it came forward, others succeeded those who fell, and fresh numbers
      momentarily appeared. The troops, terrified at the armed crowds who
      swarmed through the Three-bullet Gate, and who, maddened by inebriety and
      fanaticism, seemed rather to court death than avoid it, the defenders at
      last despairing of offering a longer resistance against myriad hordes of
      infuriated fiends, retreated across the bridge.

      the causes already related as having induced Harvey and his rebel myriads
      to feel confident of easily securing the strategically important town of
      Ross, that the insurgents had been induced to think that the militia
      regiments at Ross, from being almost entirely composed of Romanists, would
      have either joined them in the action, or offered a feeble opposition. The
      Clare regiment was considered friendly, and the Dublin County were
      believed not particularly loyal or trustworthy. <i>The MS. Journal of a
      Field Officer</i> is enlightening upon these points:&mdash;&lsquo;Be this as it
      may, their colonel, Lord Mountjoy, was heading them up the street leading
      to the Three-bullet Gate when he met his death by a traitorous shot, and
      the attachment which his men bore him superseded every other feeling but a
      desire for revenge. Although they had retired at first before the torrent,
      they rallied instantly, and showed no appearance of disaffection
      afterwards, but fought stoutly at Vinegar Hill. Lord M. was riding a
      little way ahead of the regiment when he was treacherously shot from a
      window by a baker&rsquo;s boy. Such were the results of the fall of Furlong on
      the one side, and the death of Lord Mountjoy on the other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The forced abandonment of the bridge was a heavy repulse. Virtually the
      day was lost, for although a small party of the royalists, under Sergeant
      Hamilton, still held most gallantly a position in the vicinity of the
      Three-bullet Gate, had the insurgents followed up their success, a total
      and bloody defeat of the king&rsquo;s troops must have been unavoidable. But,
      once within the town, drink and plunder engrossed the attention of the
      majority, while the admirable gallantry of that brave old man who
      commanded the retreating royalists retrieved the fortunes of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Crossing to the Kilkenny side, General Johnson rallied the fugitives and
      urged them to follow him once more. &lsquo;Will you desert your General?&rsquo; he
      exclaimed to the disheartened militia; but this appeal was coldly heard.
      &lsquo;And your countryman, too?&rsquo; he added. The chord of national honour was
      touched, a cheer answered it, the old man wheeled his horse round, and,
      riding in front, brought back his rallied troops to the fight, and,
      rejoining the staunch few who still held the post beside the Three-bullet
      Gate, announced that a large reinforcement had just arrived from
      Waterford. When the fortune of a doubtful day is in the balance, a feather
      turns it frequently. Such was the case at Ross. The troops cheered, and
      plied their musketry with additional spirit and excellent effect, and,
      turning the rebel rear, put their massive column into a confusion which
      proved irretrievable, and at last, with desperate slaughter, drove them
      fairly from the town. The exhaustion of the garrison prevented anything
      being attempted beyond a brief pursuit in the direction of Corbet Hill,
      while the rebels made no effort to rally and renew the action, but went
      off dispersedly, some to their old camp at Carrickbyrne, and others to a
      new position which they had taken on a height called Slieve Keilter, some
      four miles&rsquo; distance from the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this, the most sanguinary and hardly contested action of the
      insurrection, commencing at five in the morning and ending at three in the
      afternoon, the loss on both sides was immense, although in gross numbers
      wholly disproportionate. Musgrave states the rebels killed to have
      exceeded 2500, besides the many &lsquo;carried off on cars.&rsquo; Before the walls,
      between Three-bullet and Bunnion Gates, and in the cross lanes and streets
      which led directly to the market-place, the slaughter was enormous.
    </p>
    <p>
      In Chapel Lane the rebels lay three deep, and throughout the approaches to
      the main guard the streets were heaped with corpses.
    </p>
    <p>
      The defence of this post, and the assistance afforded to the few brave men
      who held it, were characteristic of the desperate fighting which marks the
      uncompromising spirit that religious and political antipathies produce. A
      most gallant soldier, Sergeant Hamilton of the Donegal Regiment, with
      sixteen men and two ship-guns, indifferently mounted, were posted at the
      intersection of four streets in the immediate vicinity of the jail. When
      the troops retreated over the bridge, Hamilton was recommended to remove
      the spare ammunition he had in charge and quit a post where now he must
      remain isolated and unsupported. His reply was, &lsquo;Never, but with life!&rsquo; 
      and though frequently assailed by hundreds, he laned them literally with
      grape-shot, covering the approach to the guns with dead and dying men, and
      through every turn of a doubtful conflict resolutely maintaining his
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although the leading streets were completely under his fire, the gallant
      sergeant was open to attack from a narrow lane immediately beside the main
      guard, where, sheltered from the cannon, the rebels could form in
      security; and, no doubt, from that point they would have carried the post
      by a sudden onset had not a fortunate circumstance afforded the Donegal
      soldiers protection from the threatened danger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house of a loyalist called Dowesley was in the Backhouse Lane, and
      occupied by the family and a lame pensioner. The part of the lane where
      the rebels were safe from the fire of Hamilton&rsquo;s guns was, however,
      commanded by Dowesley&rsquo;s windows; and whenever the insurgents attempted to
      form and attack the main guard, a close and constant fusilade from the
      little garrison of the house drove them from a place where they expected
      to find shelter while collecting for their intended attack. As fast as the
      muskets were discharged the old soldier quickly reloaded them, adding half
      a dozen buck-shot to the bullet, and so deadly was the fire from
      Dowesley&rsquo;s dwelling that upwards of fifty bodies were found after the
      action heaped together in the lane.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Tottenham, the proprietor of Ross, employed six carts and a great many
      men for two entire days in collecting the bodies of the slain. Most of
      those found in the town were thrown into the river and carried off with
      the tide. The remainder were flung into a fosse outside the town wall and
      buried there. The conflict at Ross might have been shortened had the
      Roscommon regiment, which had been detached from Waterford early on the
      morning of the action, completed its march and brought its timely
      reinforcement to the exhausted garrison. It was also very fortunate the
      Roscommon regiment returned to Waterford that night, as the rebels, who
      were numerous and well organised there, meditated an insurrection,
      imagining Ross had been taken. The next day the Roscommon regiment moved a
      second time from Waterford and reached Ross with little opposition,
      although during the short interval which had occurred the country had
      risen <i>en masse</i>. On the adjacent hills parties of rebels were seen,
      and an arch of the Glynmore bridge had been partially broken, but the
      colonel planked it and passed his guns easily across. A body of rebels,
      who showed themselves upon a height, gave way after a round or two from
      the cannon, previously murdering fifteen of the refugee militiamen who had
      fled from Ross the day before, fell into these ruffians&rsquo; hands, and now
      paid the penalty of their cowardice.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the battle of Ross subsequent atrocities, which have placed the
      Wexford insurrection fearfully pre-eminent in crime, were connected. One
      foul deed, the massacre at Scullabogue, infinitely surpassed all others,
      and, with the massacres perpetrated wholesale on Wexford Bridge and
      Vinegar Hill, has cast a stain on Irish character that another century
      will scarcely remove. One reads, almost with incredulity, of Autos-da-fe
      and Eves of St. Bartholomew, and blesses God, when he finds the narrative
      is true, that his lot was not cast in an age of cruelty and darkness. But
      the narration of scenes which discoloured the Irish rebellion makes one
      blush to think that the wolfish wretches who were the actors therein bore
      the common name of man. It is a revolting detail that historic
      impartiality forces on the writer, and it shall be briefly despatched.

      <span class="head">MASSACRE AT SCULLABOGUE</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen the rebels
      encamped on Carrickbyrne they established an outpost at the house of
      Scullabogue, which had been deserted by its proprietor, Captain King. A
      large barn was attached to the mansion; it was 34 feet long, 15 feet in
      breadth, and 12 feet high. This outhouse and the mansion itself had been
      made a prison wherein to deposit the unfortunate prisoners who by their
      loyalty or their difference in religious faith had incurred the
      displeasure of the rebels, and fell after the outbreak into their hands;
      and on the morning when the rebels marched on the attack of Ross, 230
      ill-fated victims were then confined in a building, which proved at once
      their prison and their grave. A rebel guard was left to secure the
      captives, amounting to 300 men, under the command of three subordinate
      leaders, named Murphy of Loughnageer, Devereux, and Sweetman. The
      particulars of the butchery which took place on the fatal 5th of June will
      be best understood by abstracts from evidence upon oath, given on the
      trials of some of the monsters implicated in this hellish sacrifice. Any
      person who wishes for more extensive details of this most atrocious
      transaction will find them duly verified in the voluminous appendix
      attached to Musgrave&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The depositions of sundry persons are briefly abridged. One who escaped
      the massacre, by the bribery of a rebel and the virtue of a priest&rsquo;s
      protection, gives the following account of this horrible transaction. He
      states that, when the rebel army began to give way at Ross, an express was
      sent to Murphy to put the Protestant prisoners to death, as the king&rsquo;s
      troops were gaining the day; but Murphy refused to comply without a direct
      order from the general. That he soon after received another message to the
      same purpose, with this addition, that &lsquo;the prisoners, if released, would
      become very furious and vindictive.&rsquo; That, shortly after, a third express
      arrived, saying, &lsquo;the priest gave orders that the prisoners should be put
      to death.&rsquo; That the rebels, on getting the sanction of the priest, became
      outrageous, and began to pull off their clothes, the better to perform the
      bloody deed. That, when they were leading the prisoners out from the
      dwelling-house to shoot them, he turned away from such a scene of horror,
      on which a rebel struck him with a pike upon the back, and said he would
      &lsquo;let his guts out if he did not follow him!&rsquo; That he then attended the
      rebels to the barn, in which there was a great number of men, women, and
      children, and that the rebels were endeavouring to set fire to it, while
      the poor prisoners, shrieking and crying out for mercy, crowded to the
      back door of the building, which they forced open for the purpose of
      admitting air. That for some time they continued to put the door between
      them and the rebels, who were piking or shooting them. That, in attempting
      to do so, their hands or fingers were cut off. That the rebels continued
      to force into the barn bundles of straw to increase the fire. At last,
      that the prisoners having been overcome by the flame and smoke, their
      moans and cries gradually died away in the silence of death&mdash;and all
      became still.

      The witness, during this dreadful scene, saw a child, who got under the
      door and was likely to escape, although much hurt and bruised, when a
      rebel perceiving it, thrust his pike through it and threw it into the
      flames. While the rebels were shooting the prisoners in front of the
      dwelling-house, a party of men and women were engaged in stripping and
      rifling the dead bodies; and the prisoner, Phelim Fardy, called out to
      them to avoid the line of his fire (as he was busily employed in shooting
      the prisoners), and after saying so, he fired at a man who was on his
      knees, who instantly fell and expired. Another ruffian, whose barbarities
      made him conspicuous, trampled on the dead and wounded bodies, and behaved
      otherwise in such a ferocious manner as to obtain from the rebels the
      appellation of &lsquo;the true-born Roman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The barn was so limited in size that suffocation must have soon taken
      place from the great number of people compressed into a space so small;
      for besides the burning of the thatched roof of the barn, the rebels fed
      it by introducing blazing faggots on their pikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Richard Grandy, who was present, swore the prisoners were led out by fours
      to be shot, and that the rebels who pierced them when they fell took a
      pleasure in licking their spears.
    </p>
    <p>
      A gentleman present, who had a narrow escape, assured the writer that a
      rebel said he would try the taste of orange blood, and that he dipped a
      tooth-pick in the wound of one of the Protestants who was shot and put it
      into his mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whenever a body fell on being shot, the rebel guards shouted and pierced
      it with their pikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      They burned there several wives and some of the children of the North Cork
      Militia in the barn, who were Roman Catholics; but it was sufficient to
      provoke their vengeance that they were connected with the soldiers of an
      heretical king.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most innocent victims were sacrificed; a girl was brought there in
      place of her sister; she was seized and sent to the barn, and her father
      shortly after, having gone there with his poor old wife to solicit her
      liberation; the parents and child were thrust into the barn together, and
      burned with the other unfortunates. No less than twenty-four Protestants
      were taken from the village of Tintern, about eight miles distant, many of
      them old and feeble, and led in one drove to the barn, where they
      perished. Two Romanists, serving-men, were burnt in the barn because they
      would not consent to the massacre of their Protestant masters. Another
      Romanist, who was travelling with a royalist pass for his protection, was
      intercepted by the rebels, who considered the pass an emblem of loyalty;
      they committed him to the barn, with a son who happened to accompany him,
      and both perished in the flames.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his history of these events Taylor, after recording the dreadful
      massacre of Scullabogue, thus describes the retreat of the rebels from New
      Ross, and pictures Baganel Harvey&rsquo;s feelings when he viewed the scene of
      the fearful tragedy enacted at the fatal barn: &lsquo;After ending this horrid
      massacre, the rebels marched (exulting in their diabolical achievements)
      towards New Ross, but the destroying angel had gone before them, and
      miserably defeated that huge army in which they trusted. As they proceeded
      to reinforce their brother rebels they met multitudes of the wounded
      returning, some crawling along as well as they could, others on horses and
      on cars; some were shot through different parts of the body, while others
      had broken arms, legs, and thighs. Going on further, they met the remnant
      of the main body retreating in the greatest confusion, hurry, and noise,
      bringing with them cars full of the dead and wounded. They took their
      station on Carrickburn that night; several stole home, and never joined
      them more, particularly those of Barony Forth, who, though a race of
      cowards, were cruel in the extreme.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning Baganel Harvey was in the greatest anguish of mind when
      he beheld Scullabogue House and the barn, where the murdered Protestants
      were to be seen in every attitude. They lay so close, that several were
      standing up against the walls, and many lying in heaps in each other&rsquo;s
      arms among the ashes of the timber of the house, while their bodies looked
      frightful, being burned to a cinder. He turned from the scene with horror,
      wrung his hands, and told those around him that &lsquo;as innocent people were
      burned there as ever were born, and that their conquests for liberty were
      at an end.&rsquo; He then said privately to a friend, &lsquo;I see now my folly in
      embarking in any cause with these people. If they succeed I shall be
      murdered by them; if they are defeated, I shall be hanged.&rsquo; Now convinced
      of the sanguinary feelings of his followers, he was determined to put a
      stop to it, as far as in his power lay, and that day he issued a
      proclamation, had it printed, sent many copies to Vinegar Hill, Wexford,
      and Gorey, and distributed them over the country.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Saturday, the 9th of June, 184 skeletons were cleared out of the barn,
      thrown into a ditch near the place, and slightly covered with clay.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is every reason to believe that this horrible atrocity occasioned to
      all but the lowest barbarians, who were banded with the rebel forces,
      feelings of alarm and disgust. Almost the last act of Baganel Harvey
      before he was deprived of his command was the publication of a general
      order to restrain future acts of violence, under the penalty of death; and
      he originated a subscription&mdash;in which many rebel leaders joined&mdash;to
      pay for the interment of the poor sufferers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Years afterwards, record all the authorities who have dwelt on this cruel
      episode, it was the greatest wish of such of the Wexford rebels as
      survived, to prove that, in whatever crimes they might have participated
      largely, they were wholly unconnected with the burning of Scullabogue.

      The plans disclosed in this letter came near to complete realisation; but
      for the events of Ross and Arklow, who can say that the results

      The lowest ruffians had become leaders of the mob, and several monsters,
      who desecrated the holy orders intrusted to them, encouraged the
      barbarities of their besotted followers and pandered to their
      superstitions. Among these wretches Murphy of Bannow and Roche of
      Paulpearsay were conspicuous. The latter, like Murphy of Ballycanoo, was a
      bullet-catcher, and while he occasionally distributed to his flock balls
      which had been caught in action, he promised an immunity from danger to
      the faithful&mdash;for a consideration. &lsquo;He would give them gospels,&rsquo; he
      said (they were generally sewed to a brown-coloured tape), &lsquo;to hang about
      their necks, which would make the person who wore it proof against all the
      powers of heretical artillery; but that notwithstanding their
      extraordinary utility to the Irish army, they would be of no avail unless
      they were purchased. The price to the better sort of people was
      half-a-crown; but as the poorer were zealous in the glorious cause, he
      would only ask from them a sixpence.&rsquo; Says Taylor, &lsquo;Thousands of these
      gospels were made and speedily sent round the country.&rsquo;

      In the heat of action, on every repulse, and when his deluded followers
      retreated, Murphy of Ballycanoo had induced fresh victims to come forward,
      and, blinded against danger by whisky and fanaticism, they rushed on more
      than one occasion to the very muzzles of the guns. Were the fact not
      accredited beyond a doubt, it would not be believed that the drunken
      scoundrel persuaded the unhappy savages who obeyed his orders that his
      person was impervious to heretical balls, producing a handful of
      musket-bullets, which he averred had struck him during the action, or had
      been caught as they innocently whistled by. However potent the spell might
      be that saved the worthy churchman from lead, it proved inefficient
      against &lsquo;cold iron.&rsquo; A round-shot from one of the Durham guns struck him
      down while leading these ignorant wretches to the charge; the ruffian went
      to his account, and his followers broke finally and disbanded. When the
      warlike Murphy fell he was but a few paces from the barricade, and was
      waving a banner over his head emblazoned with a huge cross and the motto
      of &lsquo;Death or Liberty.&rsquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he consternation
      which the intelligence of Walpole&rsquo;s destruction occasioned in the
      metropolis may be easily imagined. Many families quitted the kingdom in
      despair. This, probably, was the gloomiest moment of that fearful period,
      but the unbounded loyalty and devotion of the Dublin Protestants shone out
      with increasing brilliancy, and assisted to dispel the gathering cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the metropolis the yeomanry amounted to nearly 4000 men, now armed,
      well disciplined, and purged from those traitors who, but a few weeks
      before, had thronged their ranks. With perfect confidence the city was
      intrusted to their protection, and from the few regular troops in
      garrison, the Cavan regiment, with a detachment of Reay Fencibles, were
      despatched to reinforce the troops in Wicklow, and enable the royalists to
      rally and recover the ground they had lost.

    <p>
      <span class="head">FATHER M. MURPHY OF BALLYCANOO AND THE HERETIC BULLETS</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      The troops were forwarded by carriages specially impressed, the command
      given to General Needham, and on the 6th of June the column quitted
      Wicklow, and after passing a deserted country and being joined by some
      yeomanry and armed loyalists, it entered Arklow early the same evening;
      some straggling rebels retiring from the town, where they had loitered,
      plundering and drinking, on the cavalry advanced guard appearing by the
      Dublin road.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reception of the troops by the inhabitants was enthusiastic, for many,
      under fear of death, had already abandoned their houses to embark in
      fishing boats, and escape from a place which they expected to become an
      immediate scene of savage violence.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the two succeeding days (7th and 8th of June) the commanding
      officer was engaged in making dispositions for the defence of the town and
      in selecting a position. Ground was marked out capable of being occupied
      by a body of troops so limited in number as the garrison; and while such
      fences were preserved as would afford cover to the royal light troops from
      which to annoy an advancing enemy, others that could neither mask their
      movements or interrupt the play of the guns were levelled and removed.
      Meanwhile the country was carefully patrolled, and alarm posts assigned to
      the different corps to take up on the rebels being reported to be in
      motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the 9th came. At noon a wing of the Durham Fencibles
      marched in under the command of an excellent officer, Colonel Skerrett,
      affording a well-timed and most effective reinforcement to the garrison,
      and, in consequence of this arrival, General Needham made a slight change
      in his dispositions, and never was a little army more curiously composed
      than the morning state of that of Arklow exhibited on the day of the
      attack upon the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the evening came on, an advanced picket announced the appearance of the
      insurgents, and consequently an infantry outpost at the Charter-house was
      called in and replaced by a cavalry patrol, while by the two great
      approaches to the town&mdash;the seaside road and that leading to
      Coolgreney&mdash;dense masses were seen moving to the attack. By the
      former road one great column directed its march against the lower part of
      the town called the Fishery; by the latter an immense mass, under the
      command of Father Murphy of Ballycanoo, threatened the upper part of
      Arklow, and thus endangered the right and rear of the royalist position.
      To deploy their unwieldy masses appeared to be a task beyond the power of
      their leaders, for more than half an hour was consumed in the attempt, and
      when they did effect the change the line was irregular and disordered, at
      some parts merely in rank entire, and at others six files deep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royalists were already in position, the line being slightly curved,
      the flanks refused, and each protected by battalion guns, with two
      six-pounders nearly in the centre. The hedges were lined by the Suffolk
      and Tyrone Militia and part of the supplementary yeomen, with a small
      party posted in the churchyard and another at the bottom of the street
      which looked upon the bridge. These posts were occupied to defend the
      lower town. The barrack walls had been provided with a &lsquo;banquette&rsquo; (a
      wooden stage attached to high walls, at an elevation which will allow the
      defenders to fire over the parapet), and supplied with musqueteers, while
      the upper end of the street was barricaded with carts and lumber, and
      defended by part of the Antrim regiment and a field-piece. Generally the
      cavalry were formed on the bridge and sands. Taking the local character of
      the place and the small number of its defenders into consideration, the
      disposition of the troops was very judicious and creditable to General
      Needham.
    </p>
    <p>
      The actual strength of the rebel army was, on the lowest calculation,
      computed at 25,000 men, and on good authority it has been even raised to
      31,000. About 5000 of the insurgents, were armed with firearms, and they
      brought two well-appointed guns into action. But it was not from their
      enormous numbers only that they were formidable. They came forward under
      the wildest enthusiasm, burning to exact vengeance for past defeats, and
      confident they must annihilate the small but daring body who, undaunted by
      a twenty-fold superiority, were steadily awaiting their attack. During the
      morning&rsquo;s march from Gorey they plundered the houses of the Protestants of
      everything valuable, putting in requisition all the spirits and provisions
      that could be supplied; and, under the double influence of intoxication
      and fanaticism, were led on by their priests, who inspired them with ideas
      of their own invincibleness; because, as they assured the misguided
      wretches, they were engaged in the cause of heaven, and opposed to the
      enemies of God. To maintain that religious frenzy which was their great
      source of courage, at the end of every mile during the march their leaders
      said mass, and used every mode of exhortation and every superstitious
      device that priestcraft could invent. They advanced in an irregular line,
      which was frequently broken by their running out to file along the
      hedge-rows lying parallel to the position of the king&rsquo;s troops, of the
      cover of which they endeavoured to avail themselves. Their front rank was
      composed of those who had firearms, and were mostly from the barony of
      Shelmalier, on the Wexford coast, where they subsist during the winter by
      shooting sea-fowl, which makes them expert marksmen. They were covered in
      the rear by the pikemen, many deep, while at certain intervals the line
      was strengthened by numerous masses of men, who were ready to supply the
      places of those who fell, or act as occasion might require. Each company
      had a green flag about two feet square, with a yellow harp in the centre,
      while some were parti-coloured, and equal in size to the king&rsquo;s colours.
      Their leaders were distinguishable riding through the ranks, marshalling
      them and giving orders. During the engagement the rebels frequently
      repeated their dreadful yells, which heightened the terrific appearance of
      a numerous host of barbarians, who seemed confident, from superior
      numbers, that they could easily overwhelm the small army that opposed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebels advanced two guns by the Coolgreney road, under a sharp and
      destructive fire from those on the right of the Durham regiment, and the
      third in position at the barricade. Both of the former were dragged up by
      lanes on the high road and placed on high grounds, one looking on the
      centre of the royalist line, the other commanding its left flank.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although tedious in their formation, the insurgent column directed against
      the lower town advanced so rapidly that they had nearly succeeded in
      cutting off a cavalry patrol, which saved itself, however, by swimming the
      horses across the Ovoca. Having fired the houses in the suburb, the rebels
      pushed on under cover of the smoke, but they never could gain the bridge,
      as the fire of the detached party, which covered that approach, and the
      second, which held the churchyard, cut down the head of the column, and
      finally disordered it so much as to allow the cavalry, formed on the
      sands, to charge with excellent effect. During a long and desperate
      struggle the troops behaved with a steadiness and determination which
      enabled them not only to secure the lower town, but to inflict a
      destructive loss upon the assailants.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the grand effort of the insurgents was directed against the left and
      centre of the position and the barricade that covered its right flank.
      From behind the hedges the rebels kept up a steady and well-directed
      fusilade, and also commanded the royal line with such effect as to
      dismount a battalion gun and oblige Colonel Skerrett to advance his left
      wing and protect it behind a fence from the fire of a field-piece, which
      otherwise must have enfiladed it. The gallantry of the Durham Fencibles
      was unbounded. Thrice the rebels came forward in immense force against the
      wing of this noble regiment, and as often a destructive volley from their
      musketry, with grape from the battalion guns, obliged the assailants to
      recede from a fire they found intolerable. But, maddened by intoxication
      and encouraged by their ghostly leader, the deluded wretches again and
      again returned to the attack, and the General, despairing of repulsing the
      continued efforts of desperate savages, determined to yield the ground and
      abandon the position. Colonel Skerrett, well aware that to retire with a
      handful of beaten troops in the presence of five-and-twenty thousand men
      would lead to their total destruction, as sternly resolved to hold the
      post he had taken to the last; and an unforeseen event decided the fortune
      of this doubtful day, and crowned the gallant few with well-merited
      victory.
    </p>
    <p>
      As long as the redoubtable Murphy of Ballycanoo&mdash;who hitherto seemed
      to bear a charmed life&mdash;remained to lead his demented and infatuated
      followers, all that the assailed could effect was to frantically hold
      their ground, their assailants continuing to rally after each repulse. It
      may be judged how critical was the situation of the defending royalists.
      Murphy, as described, had led his legions within a few paces of the
      barricade, and was encouraging his adherents by waving his famous banner
      of &lsquo;Death or Liberty&rsquo; at the head of the advancing hordes he was leading
      to the charge, when a round-shot from one of the Durham guns struck him
      down; the invincibility charm was broken, and the rebels fled dismayed.
      About eight o&rsquo;clock, when it was growing dusk, they began to retreat
      towards Coolgreney in an irregular and disorderly manner, carrying off
      nine cart-loads of dead and wounded. Had the cavalry but had sufficient
      daylight to have pursued them, they must have cut off great numbers in the
      retreat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The loss of the rebels was said to have amounted fully to one thousand,
      while that of the royalists in killed and wounded did not exceed sixty or
      seventy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although night saved the rebels from any pursuit, and probably thus abated
      their losses extensively, as the wounded were enabled to crawl away, the
      moral effect of their defeat was incalculable, obliterating entirely the
      false confidence which the affairs at Oulart and Three Rocks and the
      calamity at Tubberneering had produced. The mischief occasioned by their
      first neglect of seizing Arklow when deserted by its garrison was
      consummated by the defeat attendant on the attempt on the part of the
      rebels to redeem their original error and carry the town when it had been
      rendered defensible. Had the insurgents not lost time at Gorey&mdash;had
      they advanced and seized Arklow&mdash;Wicklow and Bray must of necessity
      have fallen into their hands without the snapping of a flint. The
      metropolis, as Father Murphy&rsquo;s intercepted letter revealed, assaulted by
      100,000 reckless men, like the warlike priest&rsquo;s followers, with the
      fourteen pieces of cannon at that time in their possession, joined in
      Dublin by the rising of a proportionate force similarly armed, might have
      effected their wicked object.
    </p>
    <p>
      The effect of the defeat, and the deductive inferences from it, as drawn
      by Gordon as our authority observes, are interesting and correct:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As the repulse at Arklow,&rsquo; writes Gordon in his <i>History</i>, &lsquo;decided
      the fate of the rebellion, so it fortunately left undecided a question how
      far the Romanists would have carried religious animosity had the
      insurrection been successful. The violent acts of the insurgents at Gorey
      and its neighbourhood were not near so great as in the southern parts of
      the county. The former might, by an advocate of their cause, be coloured
      with a pretext of retaliation, since acts of the same kind had been
      committed by the loyalists, as the burning of houses, the quartering of
      men on families for subsistence, imprisonments, trials of prisoners by
      court-martial, the shooting of prisoners without trial, and the insulting
      of others by cropping the hair and covering the head with a pitched cap.
      But an opinion is entertained, I fear indeed with too much foundation,
      that if the town of Arklow had been taken, and thus a wide prospect opened
      for the success of the rebellion, the Protestants remaining in the power
      of the Catholic rebels in the county of Wexford were to have been
      massacred.
    </p>
    <p>
      Many believe also that the persons excepted from the first massacre were
      destined for ultimate slaughter on the final success of the insurgents,
      and that even such leaders of the rebels as were Protestants were to be
      included in this proscription. The war from the beginning&mdash;in direct
      violation of the oath of the United Irishmen&mdash;had taken a religious
      turn, as every civil war in the south or west of Ireland must be expected
      to take by any man acquainted with the prejudices of the inhabitants. The
      terms Protestant and Orangeman were synonymous with the mass of the
      insurgents; and the Protestants they meant to favour had been baptized
      into the Romish Church by the priests of that communion. But whatever
      degree of religious bigotry or party hatred had been hitherto discovered
      by the insurgents, there were still many individuals who evinced the
      greatest humanity in their endeavours to mitigate the fury of their
      associates.&rsquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he fatal effects
      of the defeat at Arklow in the subsequent fortunes of the insurrection
      became every day more apparent, and during these transactions the rebels
      who remained at Gorey and its neighbourhood were gradually dispersing. &lsquo;A
      part of them retired to Wexford, bringing with them the prisoners who had
      been confined in the market-house of Gorey. These had been severely
      treated; they had been supplied with food only once in the twenty-four
      hours, cropped, pitch-capped, and exposed from the windows to the insults
      of the shouting multitudes on their march to attack Arklow, while many had
      been shot or piked to death. As the mass of remaining rebels had taken
      their station on the hill of Ask, only a mile from Gorey, after the battle
      of Arklow, the royal army remained some days close within its quarters,
      sending out patrols with caution, at first to a very small distance, and
      afterwards gradually advancing further. At last a troop of yeomen cavalry
      ventured so far on the road towards Gorey as to approach the rebel station
      on Ask hill, and found the post had been so thinned by perpetual
      desertions that not more than about a hundred men fit for action were then
      remaining in it, and these without a leader.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For every reason, military and political, it was now unanimously
      determined by the royalist commanders that the relief of Wexford and
      Enniscorthy, so long and so unhappily in possession of the rebels, must be
      preceded by the capture of the camp and a total dispersion of the
      insurgent bodies collected on Vinegar Hill. To effect this difficult but
      desirable object a vigorous and well-combined attack would be required,
      and on the 16th of June the preparatory movements of the different corps
      were arranged by General Lake; to Generals Dundas, Needham, Johnson, Sir
      Charles Asgill, Wilkinson, Sir James Duff, Loftus, and Moore were assigned
      plans of operations covering three or four days; some of these movements
      were delayed from various eventualities, and two brigades were
      unfortunately absent at the final assault on Vinegar Hill. As the attack
      was to be made immediately after daybreak on the 21st, and as it was
      utterly impossible that by any exertions his wearied troops could reach
      their ground in time, Needham despatched an aide-de-camp to the
      Commander-in-Chief requesting the advance to be delayed for an hour, to
      allow him time to get up; but General Lake could not postpone his
      movements against the rebel position, as an immediate assault upon the
      camp was absolutely necessary to prevent the enemy from detaching
      reinforcements to their friends at Enniscorthy, who were then warmly
      engaged with Johnson&rsquo;s brigade. Under these circumstances General Needham,
      finding it impossible to get the column up, very properly pushed his
      cavalry forward; and when the rebels broke upon the hill, they were
      sufficiently advanced to cut down a number of the fugitives. General Sir
      James Duff, who advanced by the Ferns road, with his right resting on the
      Slaney and his left flanked by the light infantry under General Loftus,
      reached the base of the hill with occasional interruptions from rebel
      pickets, who occupied the high grounds on the line of march, but who were
      easily dispersed by a few shells from the howitzers. Previous to
      commencing his ascent he detached General Loftus with the light infantry
      and guns to seize an eminence which overlooked the lower line of the rebel
      position, and consequently laid it open to a cannonade at easy range. The
      movement was rapidly effected, and although the enclosures were numerous
      and the ground steep, General Loftus, by breaking down the stone fences,
      was enabled to get his artillery forward, and, crowning the height with
      his guns, he opened them with excellent effect upon crowded ranks, which
      were completely enfiladed. The remainder of Duff&rsquo;s brigade pressed
      steadily up the hill, and at the same time the columns of Generals Lake,
      Wilford, and Dundas, with Campbell&rsquo;s light companies, ascended the
      south-eastern face, while Johnson&rsquo;s brigade mounted from Enniscorthy.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the troops advanced they sustained a sharp fire from the rebel
      marksmen, who, acting <i>en tirailleur</i>, lined the numerous enclosures
      and disputed them with some spirit. The rebel cannonade was ineffective,
      although they had thirteen pieces of various calibres on the hill, but
      their musketry was well sustained, and yet, with all the advantages of a
      strong position, the loss inflicted on the assailants was infinitely less
      than could have been anticipated. The steady advance of the troops was
      never for a moment checked, and the movements of the columns so admirably
      timed that they crowned the hill simultaneously, while the rebels,
      availing themselves of the means of retreat which General Needham&rsquo;s
      failure had unluckily left open, went off <i>en masse</i>, abandoning
      their cannon, ammunition, and all the plunder that had been accumulated
      during the period they had occupied their savage and sanguinary
      encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the wholesale destruction of a deluded multitude were a desirable
      object, certainly the failure of this movement is to be lamented, for the
      rebels were enabled to get off bodily, whereas had Needham reached his
      ground they must have been so totally <i>derouted</i> that no exertions
      could have rallied them again, and the flame of rebellion would have been
      extinguished. But the results of his failure, and not the cause, were
      severely tested at the time, and the General was censured with injustice
      for a miscarriage, occasioned by circumstances entirely beyond control,
      and of everyday recurrence in war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The brunt of the action, and the greatest proportion of the loss, fell
      upon the brigade commanded by General Johnson (afterwards Sir Henry
      Johnson, G.C.B., who may be said, in the rebellion of 1798, to have been
      the military saviour of Ireland). On the evening preceding the attack on
      Vinegar Hill, that General advanced within a mile and a half of
      Enniscorthy, intending to bivouac in the vicinity of the rebel position,
      and bring his column fresh into action the next day. The troops had
      scarcely, however, piled arms when the rebels in great force issued from
      Enniscorthy and moved forward with the apparent intention of attacking the
      royalists and hazarding a general action. They advanced in close columns,
      covered by a number of sharpshooters, and connected by several bodies,
      formed in irregular lines. The rebel skirmishers, after maintaining a
      sharp fusilade, were speedily dislodged by the fire of the cannon, and,
      falling back on the supporting column, which had halted on an eminence
      half a mile from the ground occupied by the royalists, the guns were
      directly turned upon the height.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this occasion these unfortunate and deluded men evinced an ignorance of
      warlike missiles which can hardly be conceived. As the round shot from the
      guns bedded themselves in the face of the hill against which they had been
      directed, the rebels rushed in numbers to pick them up. A shell from a
      howitzer falling, it was exultingly surrounded by a crowd of men, each
      struggling to become owner of this god-send. The effect of the explosion
      may be fancied, as when the fuse reached the powder, more than fifty of
      the ignorant wretches were furiously contending for the possession of the
      lighted shell.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Taylor&rsquo;s <i>History</i>, &lsquo;Here they were cannonaded, and on
      seeing the shells they were driven into the utmost confusion, as they
      could not conceive what they were, some shouting in a kind of delirium (as
      shell followed shell), &ldquo;They spit fire at us&rdquo;; others, &ldquo;We can stand
      anything but these guns which fire twice!&rdquo; Indeed the carnage occasioned
      by them was very great, and fully answered the end.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The night passed, and at daybreak Johnson drove the rebels from the height
      and forced them back upon Enniscorthy. After halting an hour, to allow the
      general attack upon the hill to operate as a diversion and employ the main
      body of the enemy, Johnson pushed his column into the town. On this
      occasion the rebels made a stubborn resistance, their pikemen disputing
      the streets and their musketry firing upon the advancing troops from the
      windows. Every yard was stoutly contested, and a six-pounder, advanced
      into the open space before the court-house, was carried by a sudden rush,
      the gunners killed, and the piece captured by the pikemen. But it was
      immediately retaken; the bridge was cleared of the enemy, the Dublin
      regiment cheered and pressed up the hill, and although that ascent was the
      steepest, the brave old man reached the summit as the other columns
      cleared it.
    </p>
    <p>
      The royalist casualties were comparatively trifling, and the rebel loss
      fell infinitely short of what might have been expected from a <i>déroute</i>
      so complete as that which followed the loss of their favourite position.
      As the greater number of the insurgents were cut down dispersing in the
      pursuit, the amount could not be correctly estimated. Probably three or
      four hundred might have been slain. One of their favourite generals, a
      church-militant leader, was included in the casualties of the day, for
      Father Clinch of Enniscorthy was killed while retreating after the action.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a military criticism which is placed here while summarising the
      results of this action. It is given in the <i>M.S. Journal of a Field
      Officer</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;There is one point which has never been explained to
      my satisfaction. After the defeat at Vinegar Hill the main body of the
      rebels retreated to Wexford, where they divided&mdash;one column crossed
      Wexford bridge, and made their way to the north of the county about Gorey;
      now this body must have been due north while General Lake was moving due
      south from Vinegar Hill upon Wexford, so that they must have actually
      passed each other at a distance of not six miles between the parallel
      roads, as a glance at the map will show. Perhaps General Lake did not
      consider himself strong enough to divide and occupy both roads to Wexford,
      or perhaps he might have thought &ldquo;the stag at bay&rsquo;s a dangerous foe,&rdquo; and
      permitted them to weaken themselves by allowing them to quietly disbandon.
      It cost, however, much loyal blood at Gorey.&rsquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>exford was a scene
      of unexampled horror, where were enacted the most sanguinary barbarities
      in emulation of the bloodthirsty atrocities of the reign of terror; nor
      can it be an excuse that the monsters avowedly imitated those terrorising
      scenes which were made luridly familiar by the annals of the French
      Revolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plunder of houses and the incarceration of their innocent victims
      after the unfortunate defeat of the Meath detachment at the Three Rocks,
      which determined Colonel Maxwell&rsquo;s fatal retreat from Wexford, immediately
      occupied the insurgents.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the rabble were engaged in collecting numbers of ill-fated
      Protestants for future slaughter, the leaders went through the mockery of
      establishing a provisional government, and, in imitation of the French
      Jacobins, a grand national committee, a council of elders, and a council
      of five hundred were to be organised forthwith, while the dwelling-house
      of a wealthy merchant was put into requisition as a senate-house, wherein
      the different estates were to legislate for the young republic.
    </p>
    <p>
      If it were necessary to prove the fallacy that any possibility exists of
      retaining influence over a sanguinary and superstitious mob by any means
      but acting on their ignorance or pandering to the worst passions of brutal
      dispositions, the rebel occupation of Wexford would afford an ample
      evidence, and the president of the council and the governor of the town,
      in their own sad stories, tell that the baser the <i>materiel</i> of the
      mob, the briefer is the authority of those who undertake the direction of
      its movements. Every day during the rebel occupation of the town and
      adjacent encampments, fresh victims continued to be brought in by the
      savage pikemen. In Wexford a small sloop, the town jail, and subsequently
      the market-house, were filled with unhappy sufferers. A reign of terror
      had commenced, the rabble power had become predominant, and all persons of
      superior rank or a different faith were denounced by wretches who
      associated crime with religion and slaughtered in the name of God. The
      chiefs themselves, particularly those few among them who had been educated
      in the Protestant religion, were in perpetual danger of death or violence
      from an ungovernable multitude, whom they had unwisely hoped to command.
    </p>
    <p>
      With such feelings and dispositions it will be a subject of regret, but
      not surprise, that now the ferocity of the rabble resisted all control and
      blood alone could appease it. The death decree of the wretched prisoners
      went forth, and the fearful story of the massacre is recorded by one who
      miraculously escaped the fate of his less fortunate companions. It is a
      fearful record of butchery, and, alas! the statement is not over-coloured.
      The leading monster of these executions was Thomas Dixon, a relative of
      the priest, and he may well be described as a fiend in human form.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the 19th of June the Protestants in Wexford received the heart-rending
      intelligence that all the prisoners were to be murdered the next day. That
      night also, one of them, while sitting alone in silent sorrow, heard the
      death-bell toll as loud as ever she heard it, and much more awfully. On
      the following morning, the never-to-be-forgotten 20th of June, Thomas
      Dixon rode to the gaol-door and swore that not a prisoner should be alive
      against sun-set. He then rode into the street repeating the same, with
      horrid imprecations, adding &lsquo;that not a soul should be left to tell the
      tale.&rsquo; Good God! how shall I proceed? neither tongue nor pen can describe
      the dismal aspect of that melancholy day,&mdash;a day in which the sun did
      not so much as glimmer through the frowning heavens. The town-bell rang,
      and the drums beat to arms to assemble the rebels for the purpose of
      joining those at Three Rocks to march against General Moore&rsquo;s brigade. In
      the evening Dixon assembled the murdering band, and immediately hoisted
      that harbinger of destruction, the <i>Black Flag</i>, which had on one
      side a bloody cross, and on the other the initials M.W.S., that is,
      &lsquo;murder without sin,&rsquo; signifying that it was no sin to murder a
      Protestant. Having paraded for some time to give more solemnity to the
      scene, the Protestants who were confined in the gaol and prison ship were
      led forth to the slaughter, and conducted to the bridge under a strong
      guard of merciless ruffians, piked to death, with every circumstance of
      barbarous cruelty, and then flung into the river to leave room for more!
      While this work of blood was going on, a rebel captain ran to the Popish
      bishop and entreated of him &lsquo;for the mercy of Jesus&rsquo; to come and save the
      prisoners. The bishop coolly replied that &lsquo;it was no affair of his.&rsquo; All
      this time the sanguinary pikemen continued butchering the poor victims on
      the bridge; some they perforated in places not mortal, to prolong and
      increase their torture, others they would raise aloft on their pikes, and
      while the miserable victim writhed in extreme agony, his blood streaming
      down the handles of their pikes, they exulted round him with savage joy.
      In the midst of this terrific scene General Edward Roche galloped up in
      great haste and commanded the drums to beat to arms, declaring that
      Vinegar Hill was nearly surrounded by the king&rsquo;s troops, and that all
      should repair to camp, as reinforcements were wanting. This express had a
      wonderful effect; the assassins instantly closed the bloody scene and fled
      in all directions. Some of the rebel guard returned soon after and
      conveyed the prisoners back to gaol. But that sanguinary monster, Thomas
      Dixon, returning, he soon evinced that his thirst for blood was not yet
      satiated by ordering out the remainder of the prisoners from the gaol and
      prison ship, the greater part of whom were tortured to death in like
      manner as the former. He then proceeded to the market-house, and having
      fixed his vulture eye on others, dragged them to the fatal bridge for
      execution. After butchering these, a lot of ten more was brought forth and
      barbarously murdered. The third time they took out eighteen, and were
      massacring them when Dick Monk rode into town from Vinegar Hill, with his
      shoes and stockings off, and shouted, &lsquo;D&mdash;n your souls, you
      vagabonds, why don&rsquo;t you go out and meet the enemy that are coming in, and
      not be murdering in cold blood?&rsquo; Some Protestant women followed him and
      asked him, &lsquo;What news?&rsquo; He replied, &lsquo;Bad news, indeed; the king&rsquo;s forces
      are encamped round Vinegar Hill.&rsquo; He then rode towards the convent.
      Shortly after, Priest Collin was seen running towards the bridge. There
      were six of the poor Protestants killed out of the last party that were
      taken down before he arrived, and it was with great difficulty he
      prevailed on them to spare the rest. After using all the arguments he
      could, without effect, he at length took off his hat and desired them to
      kneel down and pray for the souls of the poor prisoners before they put
      them to death. They did so, and having got them in the attitude of
      devotion, he said, &lsquo;Now pray to God to have mercy on your souls, and teach
      you to show that kindness towards them which you expect from Him in the
      hour of death and in the day of judgment!&rsquo; This had the desired effect; he
      led them off the bridge without opposition, and they were sent back to
      confinement. The massacre of that day ceased about eight o&rsquo;clock in the
      evening. Out of forty-eight prisoners who had been confined in the
      market-house, nineteen only escaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nor were these dreadful cruelties confined to the town alone. In their
      camps, and on their marches and retreats, the same execrable barbarities
      were constantly committed. No exaggeration can be imputed to those who
      escaped death, and afterwards described the sufferings they had undergone;
      for the dying confessions of many who were actors in those scenes of
      blood, and afterwards paid the penalty of crime, corroborated the
      statements of those who had been their prisoners, and confirmed their
      truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jackson&rsquo;s <i>Narrative</i> affords further dreadful details of the
      Protestant martyrdoms enacted on Wexford bridge:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They thus continued till about seven o&rsquo;clock to convey parties of
      prisoners, from ten to twenty, from the gaol, the market-house, and the
      prison ship, where many of them were confined, to the bridge, where they
      butchered them. Every procession was preceded by the black flag, and the
      prisoners were surrounded by ruthless pikemen, as guards and executioners,
      who often insultingly desired them to bless themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The mob, consisting of more women than men, expressed their savage joy on
      the immolation of each of the victims by loud huzzas.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The manner in general of putting them to death was thus: Two rebels
      pushed their pikes into the breast of the victim, and two into his back;
      and in that state (writhing with torture) they held him suspended till
      dead, and then threw him over the bridge into the water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After they had massacred ninety-seven prisoners in that manner, the
      insurgents were taken off their blood-thirsty work by the cry &ldquo;to camp! to
      camp!&rdquo;&rsquo;

      Musgrave, in the Appendix to his <i>Memoirs</i>, relates:&mdash;&lsquo;After

      immediately began, and continued every day, more or less, for twenty-five
      days&mdash;a dreadful specimen of what might be expected from such a
      government. One day they were so diabolical as to murder all the
      Protestants they had; and not satisfied with this, they sent to Wexford
      for more, and every day parties ranged the country, dragging forth all
      they could find, to satiate their thirst for blood.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It is said that not less than four hundred Protestants were massacred in
      Enniscorthy and on Vinegar Hill, the bodies of whom lay unburied during
      several days.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, the final scene of the tragic occurrences promised to equal,
      and perhaps exceed, the terrible events which had preceded it. There is
      little doubt that a general and unsparing massacre of the Protestants had
      been resolved upon; and although, assisted by an alarm that their camp was
      being attacked, the Catholic bishop and clergy had induced the greater
      number of the insurgents to quit the town, still the most ferocious
      wretches remained, and seemed determined to conclude a period of anarchy
      and terrorism by a scene of indiscriminating slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the confusion which the precipitate flight of the rebels occasioned
      (when they proposed to fire the town, only had no time!), the bloody
      Thomas Dixon, mounted on a very fine horse, rode through the streets with
      a broad sword drawn and upbraided the rebels for their timidity and their
      dilatoriness. &lsquo;If you had followed my advice,&rsquo; he said, &lsquo;in putting all
      the heretics to death three or four days ago, it would not have come to
      this pass.&rsquo; Mrs. Dixon&mdash;a worthy mate of her sanguinary husband&mdash;who
      accompanied him on horseback with a sword and case of pistols, clapped the
      rebels on the back and encouraged them by saying, &lsquo;We must conquer; I know
      we must conquer!&rsquo; and she exclaimed repeatedly, &lsquo;My Saviour tells me we
      must conquer!&rsquo; They repaired to the bridge to stop the retreat of the
      rebels, but in vain, though Mrs. Dixon drew a pistol and swore vehemently
      &lsquo;that she would shoot any one who would refuse to return with her to put
      the remainder of the heretics to death!&rsquo; They endeavoured to raise the
      portcullis of the bridge to prevent retreat, but were unable to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      It has been said that the butcheries on Wexford bridge were perpetrated by
      a small section of the insurgents, kept by that sanguinary monster, Thomas
      Dixon, in a state of constant drunkenness, and ever ready to execute his
      ruthless orders. Every means were used by the ruffian to play upon the
      credulity and excite the worst passions of his followers, and his fiendish
      inventions to irritate a brutal mob appear almost incredible.
    </p>
    <p>
      The approach of Moore&rsquo;s brigade, however, freed Wexford from the banditti
      who infested it to the last moment, and averted the intended massacre.
      &lsquo;Captain Boyd, the member for the town, and commandant of a corps of
      mounted yeomen, having ascertained that the great body of the rebels had
      returned, asked and obtained permission from General Moore to enter
      Wexford, and announce that the army was on its march to occupy the place.
      Attended by only a dozen mounted yeomen, Captain Boyd galloped down the
      streets, proclaiming to the inhabitants their deliverance. At five in the
      evening Moore&rsquo;s brigade arrived at the heights commanding Wexford, and
      bivouacked on the Windmill Hill, while a wing of the Queen&rsquo;s regiment
      marched into the place and took military possession. Description fails in
      attempting to set forth the emotions which arose in the breasts of the
      poor Protestants who had been doomed to destruction. Many wept with joy to
      see their deliverers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The Wexford prisons had been scarcely emptied of the Protestant prisoners
      who had occupied them until they were tenanted by those who had lately
      been the directors of the insurrection. General Lake arrived on the 22nd,
      and took up his quarters in the house of Captain Keugh, the ex-governor,
      the latter exchanging his former domicile for a jail.

      <span class="head">SUMMARY FATE OF THE INSURRECTIONARY CHIEFS</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hile some of the
      rebel chiefs endeavoured to evade the first outbreak of the royalist
      excitement by seeking a temporary security in concealment, others, under
      the persuasion that the negotiations between the Wexford leaders and the
      commanding officers of the troops would lead to a general amnesty, or,
      perhaps, in the desperation of their circumstances, remained in their
      respective homes, and quietly awaited the fate they knew to be impending.
      Grogan had retired to his mansion at Johnstown, while Harvey repaired to
      Bargy Castle, from whence, as a peace-offering, he sent some fat cattle to
      the commanding officer in Wexford. On the return of the messenger he found
      that to the chiefs of the insurgents mercy would not be extended, and
      quitting his house, never to revisit it, he set out to join a
      fellow-unfortunate, who had vainly endeavoured to remove himself beyond
      the reach of the vengeance of the outraged laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Colclough, with his wife and child, had sought a temporary asylum in one
      of the Saltee Islands, about six leagues from Wexford; with some valuables
      hastily collected, and a few necessaries to maintain life, they had hidden
      themselves in a cave, of which the entrance was artfully concealed. There
      Harvey joined the unhappy fugitives; and chiefly through the indiscretion
      with which he had neglected to keep his fatal visit secret, the whole
      party were arrested, brought back, and committed to close custody.

      <span class="head">THE CAPTURE OF COLCLOUGH AND HARVEY</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>o these
      unfortunate gentlemen, John Colclough of Ballyteigue and B. Baganel Harvey
      of Bargy Castle, late commander-in-chief of the Wexford insurgents, a
      melancholy interest is attached; and the retreat selected by the hapless
      fugitives has an air of romance that makes it interesting. The subject of
      George Cruikshank&rsquo;s realistic illustration of this picturesque incident is
      founded upon the account given in Musgrave&rsquo;s <i>Memoirs</i>:&mdash;&lsquo;The
      arrest of B. B. Harvey and John Colclough was attended with some curious
      circumstances which I shall relate. On the flight of the rebels from
      Wexford, the 21st of June, they retreated to the largest of the Saltee
      Islands, which Mr. Colclough rented from Mr. Grogan. Dr. Waddy, a
      physician who served in the yeomanry, having got intelligence of their
      retreat, applied to General Lake for a proper party and armed vessel to go
      in quest of them, which he readily obtained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About three o&rsquo;clock on Sunday evening, the 23rd of June, he set sail in
      the Rutland cutter of ten guns, commanded by Captain Willoughby, with
      Lieutenant Turner of the Queen&rsquo;s, a detachment of his regiment, and a
      man-of-war&rsquo;s boat with a party of sailors well armed. The island is about
      six leagues from Wexford, and four or five miles from the southern coast
      of the country. The weather was so tempestuous that they were obliged to
      reef their sails; and the wind being adverse, they did not descry the
      island till about four o&rsquo;clock in the morning, and could not cast anchor
      alongside till eight. When they were approaching it they saw a small boat
      pass from the island to the mainland. As it is surrounded with high
      precipices, and is accessible but in one place, and as they expected to be
      opposed by a party of armed rebels, who, it was believed, had accompanied
      Harvey and Colclough, Captain Willoughby prepared to cover their landing
      with the cutter&rsquo;s guns, and they were attended for the same purpose by the
      man-of-war&rsquo;s boat. On landing they repaired to the only house on the
      island, occupied by one Furlong, who rented it from Mr. Colclough. They
      found there an excellent feather-bed, with fine sheets which were warm, a
      handsome tea equipage, some genteel wearing apparel belonging to both
      sexes, particularly a pair of pantaloons, which Dr. Waddy had seen on Mr.
      Colclough before the rebellion; and, near the house, some silk shoes and
      other articles hid in high ferns. They searched every suspected spot in
      the island, particularly a place called the Otter&rsquo;s Cave, but in vain,
      though they had not a doubt of their having been there, as they had found,
      among other things, a chest of plate in a concealed place belonging to Mr.
      Colclough. The doctor resolved to make another effort by going round the
      island in a boat, for the purpose of reconnoitring the sides of it. In
      doing so he perceived on the edge of a high precipice one rock lighter
      coloured than the adjoining one; and, as the earth near it seemed to have
      been recently stirred, he suspected that they had been making preparations
      there for their concealment. He therefore again ascended the island, and
      found that the approach to the place which he wished to explore was steep,
      serpentine, and through some crags. The light-coloured stone covered the
      mouth of the cave, and above it was an aperture to let in the light. The
      doctor called out to Colclough and told him that if he did not surrender
      immediately, and without resistance, he should receive no quarter.
      Colclough asked, &ldquo;Is that Dr. Waddy?&rdquo; and on his saying &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said he
      would surrender; and soon after he, at the doctor&rsquo;s desire, gave up his
      arms through the hole of the cave. The doctor threw down the precipice the
      stone which covered the mouth of it, which fell with a monstrous crash; on
      which Mr. and Mrs. Colclough came forth, dressed in the meanest habits of
      peasants for the purpose of disguising themselves. Then Mr. Harvey came
      out saying, &ldquo;My God! my God!&rdquo; and so pale and weak from fatigue and
      anxiety of mind that the doctor was obliged to support him. He also had a
      chest of plate concealed, which he gave in charge of the doctor and his
      party.&rsquo;

      There was little of romance about the sequel; these unfortunates were
      simply led off by their captors direct to the scaffold. The prisoners were
      arraigned on charges of high treason, and tried by a court-martial. Among
      the first to suffer were Father Philip Roach, Captain Keugh, who deserved
      a better fate,&mdash;he had served his king in America,&mdash;and Esmond
      Kyan, rebel captain of artillery. The executions took place upon the
      bridge, and they were hurried over with little consideration to the last
      moments of the dying, or to the feelings of relations who survived them.
      Roach was a tall and weighty man, and, on being suspended, the rope broke,
      and he fell to the ground, stunned and stupefied. Another halter was
      immediately procured; he thus suffered the last penalties of the law, it
      might be said, twice over. After death the sufferers were decapitated, the
      mutilated bodies cast into the river, the heads placed upon spikes on the
      Sessions-House, exposed to public view, thus calling into operation again
      one of the most disgusting remnants of feudal severity upon offenders
      against the State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harvey&rsquo;s trial commenced on the same evening; he appeared to be much
      agitated, and spoke little. It came out in evidence that he acted as
      commander-in-chief of the rebel forces at the battle of Ross on the 5th of
      June, and his letter to the commander-in-chief of the king&rsquo;s troops,
      signed &lsquo;B. B. Harvey,&rsquo; summoning him to surrender the town to the rebels,
      was produced in evidence on the trial, and acknowledged by Mr. Harvey to
      be in his handwriting. The unhappy man produced many witnesses in his
      defence, but none to disprove the main facts. He did not deny having acted
      as commander of the rebel forces, but endeavoured to extenuate his conduct
      by saying he had accepted the distinction to prevent much greater evils,
      which must have occurred had it fallen into other hands, and in the hope
      of surrendering that command one day or other, with greater advantage to
      the country. He had no counsel, and, after a trial which lasted eight
      hours, was found guilty of death; which sentence, with that of Grogan, was
      put into execution on the morning of the 28th. His head was cut off and
      placed on the Sessions-House and his body thrown into the river. On the
      same evening was executed John Colclough of Ballyteigue. He was a
      gentleman of great respectability, and bore a very good private character.
      On this occasion the entreaties of his widowed partner were attended to,
      mutilation was dispensed with, Mrs. Colclough received the body of her
      husband, and in the poet&rsquo;s words

    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he tide of
      rebellion was ebbing fast, dissension prevailed in their councils, the
      leaders disagreed, and the Wexford men separated from those of Wicklow,
      the latter, under Garret Byrne of Ballymanus, moving off to the hill of
      Ballyraheene, nearly midway between Tinehaly and Carnew. Here another
      error in judgment occasioned an unnecessary loss of life. The yeomanry had
      pursued the rebels closely, but the latter gained the high grounds and
      formed in a very strong position. The numbers were enormously
      disproportionate, and every prudential consideration should have
      discouraged an attack. Some of the yeoman officers were of opinion that
      their troops ought to halt, and that they should content themselves with
      watching at a safe distance the movements of the enemy. Contrary opinions
      prevailing, an attack was made up the hill, when the rebels, who had
      wished to avoid a battle, rushing down, put the royalists to flight,
      killing ten of the infantry, but the cavalry escaped. Two officers fell in
      the beginning of this action, Captain Chamney of the Coolattin company,
      and Captain Nickson of the Coolkenna company, both greatly lamented.
      George Cruikshank&rsquo;s picture vividly represents the situation of Captain
      Chamney&rsquo;s house at the critical point of the siege, which saved a portion
      of this unfortunate loyalist force. &lsquo;The slaughter,&rsquo; records Gordon,
      &lsquo;would have been far greater if sixty of the infantry, under Captain
      Morton and Lieutenant Chamney, had not taken refuge in Captain Chamney&rsquo;s
      house at the foot of the hill, where they sustained during fourteen hours
      the attacks of the rebels, who attempted repeatedly to fire the house.
      Some&mdash;particularly a very large man from Gorey named John Redmond,
      nicknamed &ldquo;Shaun Plunder&rdquo;&mdash;advanced under a covering of feather-beds
      to the hall door, with the design of burning it, and thus opening a
      passage into the house; but they were killed in the attempt, the bullets
      penetrating even this thick tegument. As a discharge of musketry was
      maintained from the windows on the assailants, whose associates
      injudiciously set fire to the neighbouring house of Henry Morton (the
      owner being among the defenders of Captain Chamney&rsquo;s house), the
      illumination enabled the garrison to aim at their enemies in the night,
      and the loss of the rebels was very considerable, amounting according to
      some accounts to a hundred and thirty men, by others, to two hundred.&rsquo; 
      This ill-judged affair occurred on the 2nd of July.

      It has been described how Wexford was by the success of the king&rsquo;s forces
      ultimately liberated from the masses of its insurgent population. We have
      stated that the scene of their predatory warfare was changed from their
      native county to Kildare, and that they were reinforced by the insurgents
      commanded by Michael Reynolds. The junction produced little advantage,
      except in increasing the numbers of a tumultuary rabble, in whom there was
      neither unity of purpose nor any fixed plan of future operations. Every
      leader had some object of his own, none a particle of military talent, and
      their strategic conceptions were as erroneous as the execution was feeble
      and contemptible.

      Anthony Perry, another rebel general, despairing of doing any mischief in
      Wexford, now so well defended, where the insurgent forces were too
      dispirited to longer struggle in a body against the royalists and
      yeomanry, when joined by a strong body under the command of Michael
      Aylmer, intended to penetrate into the north of Ireland, where he expected
      to meet with a cordial co-operation. But Aylmer prevailed on Perry to
      abandon his intention, and declared that it was more advisable to attack
      Clonard, a town on the confines of Kildare and Meath, and situated on the
      river Boyne, as there was but a small force to defend it; and afterwards
      march by Kilbeggan to the Shannon, and surprise Athlone, where, from its
      central position, great advantages might be expected to arise. This plan
      was accordingly adopted; and their united forces, amounting to four
      thousand men, on the 11th of July marched to the attack of Clonard.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>any very gallant
      exploits were performed during this short and sanguinary period by
      loyalist irregulars; but probably the defence of Clonard may be placed
      foremost among numerous occurrences, in which the boundless gallantry of a
      determined handful of daring spirits repulsed the overwhelming masses to
      which they were opposed, and proved that no physical superiority can
      quench the courage of men devoted to home and altar, and determined &lsquo;to do
      or die.&rsquo; The little garrison of Clonard consisted of a weak corps of
      yeoman infantry, and its commander was a self-taught soldier. But military
      talent is intuitive, and Lieutenant Tyrrell proved that the ruder the
      storm, the more extensively the resources of a brave man will be
      developed.
    </p>
    <p>
      On being apprised that the rebel column was in march, Tyrrell made the
      best dispositions for defence which his small force permitted. He occupied
      a turret, which domineered the road, with half a dozen musketeers, and
      with the remaining twenty retired into the old mansion-house. Having
      selected his best marksmen, they were placed at such of the windows as
      offered the best positions for firing with effect upon the assailants,
      while the remainder of the corps were secured behind the walls, and
      employed in loading spare muskets to replace the firearms when discharged.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebel cavalry, amounting in rough numbers to three hundred, formed an
      advance guard, and were commanded by a man named Farrel. Unconscious that
      the garden turret was occupied, they came forward in a trot, and the first
      intimation that they were already under fire was conveyed by a shot from
      the youngest Tyrrell, a boy only fifteen years old, which mortally wounded
      the rebel captain. A volley from the other loyalists emptied several rebel
      saddles; a panic ensued, and the horsemen galloped out of musket range,
      leaving Several of their companions dead upon the road. With more caution
      and better success the rebel footmen came forward under shelter of a
      hedge, and, lining an opposite fence, they opened a sharp fire on the
      turret, while the column itself pushed forward to surround the&rsquo; house, and
      unite itself with another division which had advanced to join them by a
      cross-road. To cut off all communication and prevent the garrison from
      receiving reinforcements, the bridge was occupied by a rebel guard, but as
      it lay directly under the fire of the house, half a score of the occupants
      were rapidly shot down, the bridge cleared of its defenders, the western
      road laid open, and the garrison communication maintained.
    </p>
    <p>
      In both their first attempts the insurgents were heavily repulsed, but
      defeat seemed only to exasperate them, and they again came forward to the
      attack. Penetrating by the rear, an immense number filled the garden and
      seized the lower portion of the turret. As the ladder had been drawn up by
      the defenders of the upper story, the rebels, by climbing on each other&rsquo;s
      shoulders, attempted to force through the ceiling; still the fatal fire of
      the loyalists was kept up; at every shot a rebel fell, and on the ground
      floor lay seven-and-twenty bodies. At last, despairing of success, they
      procured a quantity of straw and fired the building. To force a passage
      through the rebels was almost a desperate attempt, but to perish in the
      flames, which had now seized the building, was the sad alternative. Two
      yeomen were killed in their attempt at escape, but fortunately the other
      four, by jumping from a window into a hay-yard under cover of the garden
      wall, succeeded in reaching the main body, who were posted in the
      dwelling-house. For six long hours this unequal contest had been
      maintained, and still no impression had been made upon the gallant
      royalists. To confuse the garrison, the assailants set fire to the
      toll-house and adjacent cabins, but the conflagration served no better
      purpose than to consume their own slain, whose bodies they flung into the
      burning houses. Happily succour was at hand, and at five in the evening a
      reinforcement was descried by the wearied royalists, advancing rapidly to
      meet them.

      that could be spared), immediately marched to their succour. The pass by
      the bridge having been kept open in the manner before related, Lieutenant
      Tyrrell now sallied from the house, and soon effected a junction with this
      reinforcement. A few volleys completely cleared the roads, and having
      placed the Northumberland Fencibles and Kinnegad infantry in such
      situations as most effectually to gall the enemy in their retreat from the
      garden, the lieutenant himself undertook the hazardous enterprise of
      dislodging them from thence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At this time it is supposed there were four hundred rebels in the garden,
      a large body being posted on a mount planted with old fir-trees, which
      afforded considerable protection, while many lay concealed behind a privet
      hedge, from where they could see distinctly every person who entered the
      garden, though unperceived themselves. The brave Tyrrell, at the head of a
      few chosen men, now rushed into the garden, and was received by a general
      discharge from both bodies of the enemy; but he instantly attacked the
      party behind the hedge, which, being defeated, retired to the mount. Here
      a warm action ensued, the enemy appearing determined to maintain their
      advantageous situation; but the yeomen, though fatigued with the heat and
      burden of the day, and six of them badly wounded, persevered with the most
      undaunted courage, and directed such a steady and well-directed fire
      against the mount, that the enemy were at length dispersed, and in their
      flight the Northumberland Fencibles and Kinnegad infantry made great havoc
      among them.&rsquo;&mdash;Taylor&rsquo;s <i>History</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rebel loss, when it is remembered that it was inflicted by a garrison
      not numbering thirty men, may appear to be overstated. In killed and
      wounded it was said to reach two hundred. Nor is there any reason to
      question the accuracy of the return. A close and well-directed fire was
      maintained for half the day, and some of the yeomanry were supposed to
      have discharged one hundred rounds a man.
    </p>
    <p>
      After this severe repulse the remaining body of insurgents retreated to
      Carbery and plundered the mansion of Lord Harburton, and next day entered
      Meath by Johnstown. On the 12th of July they were again overtaken, brought
      to action, and defeated by a detachment under Colonel Gough, hunted
      afterwards by General Myers, and driven upon Slane, and encountered ar In
      all these affairs disorganised that, as a body, they ceased to have
      existence.

      Kilkenny as their field of future operations. Their progress was marked by
      the customary atrocities of plundering and murder, and the line of march
      towards Castlecomer might have been readily traced by property destroyed
      and houses laid in ashes.

      After the continuation of their old tactics and acts of coldblooded
      treachery&mdash;such as the affair at Gore&rsquo;s bridge, when promises of
      protection were given to the discomfited loyalist soldiers surrounded in
      an untenable position, to induce them to lay down their arms, and
      scandalously violated, and in a few hours after their surrender, six
      privates of the Wexford, two of the 4th Dragoons, and nine Protestant
      prisoners were savagely butchered at Kellymount by orders of Devereux, a
      sanguinary ruffian, principally concerned in the massacre at Scullabogue&mdash;the
      insurgents were discovered at daybreak halted on Kilcomney Hill. The
      Downshire battalion guns&mdash;under Major Mathews&mdash;opened fire, and
      the rebels, to avoid the cannonade and gain time to make dispositions to
      receive the royalists, fell back a mile. While forming, Sir Charles
      Asgill&rsquo;s artillery were heard firing at a rebel party in their rear, and a
      few rounds from the Downshire guns completed their discomfiture. They
      broke, fled, and were cut down, scarcely resisting, the pursuit being
      continued for two hours with fatal effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      This was the crushing blow given to the southern insurrection. All was
      lost, for baggage, arms, provisions, and ammunition were totally
      abandoned. A few soldiers and Protestants who had fallen into their hands
      and escaped assassination were mercifully they suffered a continued loss,
      and at last had become so totally delivered and the insurgents disbanded,
      and while the Wexford party crossed into their native country through the
      Scullagh gap, the wanderers from Wicklow and Kildare went off dispersedly,
      some of the least guilty returning to their own homes, while others,
      despairing of forgiveness, commenced an outlaw&rsquo;s life, and sank the rebel
      in the robber.

      &lsquo;Father John Murphy, a priest who acted as aide-de-camp to the great
      sacerdotal hero, John Murphy of Boulavogue, and who had accompanied him
      from Vinegar Hill, fell in this action. He had a dove and a crucifix on
      his buttons, and letters directed to him were found in his pocket,
      recommending proper places for encamping. Father John Murphy, the
      commander-in-chief, who fled from the field of battle, was taken at an
      ale-house by three yeomen, one of the name of M&rsquo;Cabe, and led a prisoner
      to Tullow, the headquarters of Sir James Duff. He was introduced into a
      room where the general, his aides-de-camp, Colonels Foster and Eden, the
      Earl of Roden, Captain M&rsquo;Clintock, and about twenty officers were sitting.
      Major Hall, having asked him some questions which gave offence, in a
      violent rage the priest made a blow of his fist at the Major, which would
      have knocked him down, but that he warded it off with his arm, on which,
      however, he received a severe contusion. On searching Murphy, in his
      pockets his vestments were found, with some letters from Mrs. Richards and
      other ladies, prisoners at Wexford, imploring him to save the lives of
      their husbands and relations. He was hanged on the same day; his body was
      burned and his head fixed on the market-house.&rsquo;

      years old, light complexioned, bald-pated, and about five feet nine inches
      high, well made, uniting strength with agility. He was exceedingly
      irascible, and when in a passion had somewhat the aspect of a tiger. His
      pix, his oil stock, and a small crucifix were found in his pocket.&rsquo;

      <span class="head">LANDING OF THE FRENCH INVADERS IN KILLALLA BAY</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>n the west of
      Ireland the system of terrorism was also incessantly persevered in;
      general murders were announced, and the people continued not to sleep in
      their own houses to avoid surprise. The strangest means by which these
      imaginary massacres were to be effected were invented, promulgated, and
      believed, and the peasantry in many places actually remained night after
      night in the open fields as the only means of escaping the devilish
      devices of destroyers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musgrave has set down in his <i>Memoirs</i>: &lsquo;A few days before the French
      landed, a report was industriously circulated that the Protestants had
      entered into a conspiracy to massacre the Roman Catholics, and that they
      would not spare man, woman, or child. It was said that for this purpose a
      large quantity of combustible stuff had been introduced by the Orangemen,
      who made a kind of black candles of it; that they were of such a quality
      that they could not be extinguished when once lighted, and that in
      whatever house they should be burnt they would produce the destruction of
      every person in it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the state of Mayo and Connaught generally when, on the 22nd of
      August 1798, three French frigates, with English colours flying, entered
      Killalla Bay. No suspicion was occasioned by their appearance, and under
      the belief that they were British cruisers, several gentlemen from the
      town visited the strangers, and when declared prisoners first discovered
      their mistake.
    </p>
    <p>
      Killalla was at that time a bishop&rsquo;s see (subsequently suppressed on the
      passing of the Reform Bill). On the day when the French appeared in the
      bay the lord-bishop was holding his annual visitation, and the clergy of
      the diocese were collected in the castle, as the see-house was popularly
      called. The strange vessels, however, excited no alarm; dinner passed
      quietly, the guests were preparing to depart, when that intention was
      accelerated by the arrival of a breathless messenger to inform the company
      and their host that the French had actually landed, and an advanced guard
      of three hundred men were marching on the town.
    </p>
    <p>
      Killalla was feebly garrisoned by a party of the Prince of Wales&rsquo;s
      Fencibles and a few yeomanry, the whole not exceeding fifty or sixty men,
      but still they offered a bold resistance, until, with the loss of a few
      killed and wounded, they were finally driven into the castle and obliged
      to surrender. The commander of this extraordinary expedition, Humbert,
      after summoning the bishop to his presence, and having announced that he
      came from the great nation to give the Irish liberty and sever the yoke of
      England, which had so long oppressed them, proceeded to put into
      requisition his lordship&rsquo;s horses, sheep, and cows, intimating at the same
      time that the Irish Directory, to be established immediately in Connaught,
      would pay the full value of the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      The French officers gave the following account of the expedition:&mdash;&lsquo;About
      eighteen days before, 1500 men, some of whom had served under Bonaparte in
      Italy, the rest had been of the army of the Rhine, embarked on board three
      frigates at Rochelle, and on a very dark night eluded (beyond their
      expectation) the vigilance of the English fleet, which was close behind
      them. Two of them had forty-four guns, eighteen-pounders, the other
      thirty-eight guns, twelve-pounders. They said also they brought nine
      pieces of cannon and arms for 100,000 men, but this was French gasconnade,
      as they had arms only for 5500 men and but two four-pounders. The meagre
      persons and the wan and sallow countenances of these troops, whose numbers
      did not exceed 1060 rank and file and 70 officers, strongly indicated the
      severe hardships which they must have undergone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They hoisted a green flag in front of the castle, with the Irish words,
      &ldquo;Erin go braugh&rdquo; inscribed on it, which signifies &ldquo;Ireland for ever,&rdquo; and
      they invited the people to join them, having assured them that they would
      enjoy freedom and happiness by doing so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The first day they passed in landing arms and ammunition; the second in
      clothing and arming the natives, of whom great multitudes flocked to their
      standard, and granting commissions to Irish officers.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Compared with the other armaments destined for the invasion of Ireland,
      Humbert&rsquo;s was by far the smallest. The grand army, termed &lsquo;the reserve,&rsquo; 
      which was commanded by General Kilmaine, amounted in round numbers to
      10,000; and a second, lying in the harbour of Brest, under General Hardy,
      had 3000 men on board. Neither, however, attempted to put to sea, and
      although Kilmaine never appeared in person, his proclamations were
      abundantly distributed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humbert&rsquo;s manifesto was cleverly conceived and ingeniously put together:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      LIBERTY! EQUALITY! FRATERNITY! UNION!
    </p>
    <p>
      Irishmen&mdash;You have not forgot Bantry Bay; you know what efforts
      France has made to assist you. Her affections for you, her desire for
      avenging your wrongs and insuring your independence can never be impaired.
    </p>
    <p>
      After several unsuccessful attempts, behold Frenchmen arrived amongst you.
    </p>
    <p>
      They come to support your courage, to share your dangers, to join their
      arms, and to mix their blood with yours in the sacred cause of liberty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brave Irishmen, our cause is common; like you, we abhor the avaricious and
      bloodthirsty policy of an oppressive government; like you, we hold as
      indefeasible the right of all nations to liberty; like you, we are
      persuaded that the peace of the world shall ever be troubled, as long as
      the British ministry is suffered to make, with impunity, a traffic of the
      industry, labour, and blood of the people.
    </p>
    <p>
      But exclusive of the same interests which unite us, we have powerful
      motives to love and defend you.
    </p>
    <p>
      Have we not been the pretext of the cruelty exercised against you by the
      cabinet of St. James&rsquo;s? The heartfelt interest you have shown in the great
      events of our revolution has it not been imputed to you as a crime? Are
      not tortures and death continually hanging over such of you as are barely
      suspected of being our friends? Let us unite then and march to glory.
    </p>
    <p>
      We swear the most inviolable respect for your properties, your laws, and
      all your religious opinions. Be free; be masters in your own country. We
      look for no other conquest than that of your liberty&mdash;no other
      success than yours.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moment of breaking your chains is arrived; our triumphant troops are
      now flying to the extremities of the earth to tear up the roots of the
      wealth and tyranny of our enemies. That frightful Colossus is mouldering
      away in every part. Can there be any Irishman base enough to separate
      himself at such a happy juncture from the grand interests of his country?
      If such there be, brave friends, let him be chased from the country he
      betrays, and let his property become the reward of those generous men who
      know how to fight and die.
    </p>
    <p>
      Irishmen, recollect the late defeats which your enemies have experienced
      from the French; recollect the plains of Honscoote, Toulon, Quiberon, and
      Ostend; recollect America, free from the moment she wished to be so.
    </p>
    <p>
      The contest between you and your oppressors cannot be long.
    </p>
    <p>
      Union! liberty! the Irish republic!&mdash;such is our shout; let us march,
      our hearts are devoted to you; our glory is in your happiness. Health and
      Fraternity, Humbert, Gen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Humbert&rsquo;s was a bold but wild experiment, but still it evinced the daring
      character of the adventurer. He had encountered difficulties that would
      have disheartened a soldier less enthusiastic.
    </p>
    <p>
      To land with 1200 men in a country in full military occupation, as Ireland
      then was, without money, necessaries, or any resources but what chance and
      talent gave, proved indeed that the French general was no common soldier.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sketch given by Bishop Stock (his involuntary and captive host) of the
      invading army and their daring leader is not only graphic, but faithfully
      descriptive of the bold adventurer and his hardy followers:&mdash;&lsquo;Intelligence,
      activity, temperance, patience, to a surprising degree, appeared to be
      combined in the soldiery that came over with Humbert, together with the
      exactest obedience to discipline. Yet, if you except the grenadiers, they
      had nothing to catch the eye. Their stature for the most part was low,
      their complexions pale and sallow, their clothes much the worse for wear;
      to a superficial observer they would have appeared incapable of enduring
      almost any hardship. These were the men, however, of whom it was presently
      observed that they could be well content to live on bread or potatoes, to
      drink water, to make the stones of the street their bed, and to sleep in
      their clothes, with no covering but the canopy of heaven. One half of
      their number had served in Italy under Bonaparte; the rest were of the
      army of the Rhine, where they had suffered distresses that well accounted
      for thin persons and wan looks. Several of them declared, with all the
      marks of sincerity, that at the siege of Metz, during the preceding
      winter, they had for a long time slept on the ground in holes made four
      feet deep under the snow; and an officer, pointing to his leather
      small-clothes, assured the bishop that he had not taken them off for a
      twelve-month. Humbert, the leader of this singular body of men, was
      himself as extraordinary a personage as any in his army; of a good height
      and shape, in the full vigour of life, prompt to decide, quick in
      execution, apparently master of his art, you could not refuse him the
      praise of a good officer, while his physiognomy forbade you to like him as
      a man. His eye, which was small and sleepy (the effect, probably, of much
      watching), cast a side-long glance of insidiousness, and even of cruelty&mdash;it
      was the eye of a cat preparing to spring upon her prey. His education and
      manners were indicative of a person sprung from the lowest orders of
      society, though he knew how (as most of his countrymen can do) to assume,
      where it was convenient, the deportment of a gentleman. For learning, he
      had scarcely enough to enable him to write his own name. His passions were
      furious, and all his behaviour seemed marked with the characters of
      roughness and violence. A narrower observation of him, however, served to
      discover that much of this roughness was the result of art, being assumed
      with the view of extorting, by terror, a ready compliance with his
      demands. This latter trait in Humbert&rsquo;s character was personally
      experienced by the bishop. An offer of the presidency of the Connaught
      Directory was declined by his lordship, on the plea of his sworn
      allegiance to the king&mdash;a pledge, he said, never to be violated; and
      a command that he should issue orders to place every horse and vehicle in
      the country at Humbert&rsquo;s disposal for mounting his cavalry, and the
      transport of his guns, stores, and baggage, was evaded by an assurance
      that his lordship had been but lately a resident, and, from want of local
      knowledge or authority, had not the means of compliance with the French
      general&rsquo;s request.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Next morning Humbert, finding that no cars or horses had been procured,
      became furious, uttered a torrent of vulgar abuse, presented a pistol at
      the bishop&rsquo;s eldest son, and declared he would punish his father&rsquo;s
      disobedience by sending him to France, and accordingly he marched off the
      bishop towards the shore under a sergeant&rsquo;s guard, but when they had
      advanced a short distance a mounted orderly recalled the party, and
      Humbert apologised to the bishop, and excused, under the plea of military
      necessity, a very gross departure from the laws of <i>la politesse</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The 24th was occupied by a French <i>reconnaissance</i> on Ballina, which
      was repelled by a party of carbineers and some yeomanry. In the evening
      the royalists advanced to Killalla in return, had a smart skirmish with
      the enemy, and, after losing a few men, were hastily driven back.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On Sunday, the 26th, Humbert took the offensive, leaving six officers and
      two hundred men in Killalla to garrison the town, secure his spare
      ammunition, and drill such recruits as should join the standard of the
      republic. The French numbered about 900 bayonets, with treble that number
      of peasant partisans. They entered Ballina unopposed, and Humbert
      expressed considerable disappointment when no respectable persons welcomed
      his <i>entree</i>, and the body of an active agent suspended to a tree,
      executed by the troops before they retreated for having a French
      commission in his pocket, while it afforded an exhibition for Gallic
      civism, gave still but a sorry omen of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before he had commenced his operations the French general felt
      difficulties which, in some degree, he was unprepared for. He came totally
      unprovided with money, and in the co-operation he was led from the reports
      of Irish agents to build upon as certain he was miserably disappointed.
      The first of these difficulties he endeavoured to overcome by the issue of
      assignats on the Irish Directory that was to be.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first serious action Humbert had on encountering the royalist forces
      was signalised by a series of military mistakes, of which the French
      commander took the fullest advantage, and the memory of the loyalist
      discomfiture at Castlebar remains a discreditable page in the annals of
      our generalship.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is almost impossible to conceive anything more disgraceful and
      unaccountable than the defeat of the royalist army at Castlebar. That the
      strength of the king&rsquo;s army fully warranted its commander in covering the
      town and taking an open position cannot be denied, but still, as there was
      some uncertainty touching the number of the assailants, in the event of
      disaster measures should have been arranged for rallying the troops within
      the town, which a very little trouble would have made thoroughly
      defensible against a force so inferior as Humbert&rsquo;s. That the general
      spirit of the troops was excellent many individual cases proved, and, with
      a superior cavalry and artillery, the latter particularly well served, the
      contest should not have lasted ten minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">HEROIC CONDUCT OF THE HIGHLAND SENTINEL</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he party who
      defended the bridge of Castlebar, consisting of some gallant officers,
      some of the Longford, a few of the Kilkenny and Fraser Fencibles, suffered
      most severely, as they were exposed to a cross-fire both from the roads
      leading to it and from the houses on either side. The men often fell back,
      but were again rallied by their officers. At length most of the Royal
      Irish Artillery, who worked the gun, having been killed or wounded, it
      became useless, and the enemy were able to push forward a body of cavalry,
      whose charge was repulsed by this small party, and two of the foremost
      hussars killed within the ranks. By this charge, however, the numbers of
      the royalists were much reduced, and, having been deprived of the
      assistance of one captain and one subaltern, who were desperately wounded,
      they were at last obliged to retreat after having lost half their number.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The French appeared men qualified not only to obtain but also to improve
      a victory, and with singular daring a party of hussars, not exceeding ten
      in number, hung on the rear of the retreating royalists and overtook and
      captured a gun, which they were about to turn on the runaways, when a
      superior number of Lord Roden&rsquo;s Foxhunters charged back, killed five, and
      drove off the rest. The slain were buried where they fell, and, in memory
      of the event, the place is still called French Hill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The artillery taken in this disgraceful defeat consisted of fourteen
      pieces, of which four were curricle guns. The courageous behaviour of the
      Fraser Fencibles has been mentioned with admiration as a conspicuous
      example of gallantry against desperate odds.&rsquo;

      The spirited and characteristic water-colour drawing executed by George
      Cruikshank to illustrate the landing of the Gallic legions in Mayo deals
      with a noteworthy instance of individual and solitary devotion as related
      by Musgrave:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The French approached the new gaol to break it open. It was guarded by a
      Highland Fraser sentinel, whom his friends had desired to retreat with
      them; he heroically refused to quit his post, which was elevated, with
      some steps leading to it. He charged and fired five times successively,
      and killed a Frenchman at every shot, but before he could charge the sixth
      time they rushed on him, beat out his brains, and threw him down the
      steps, with the sentry-box on his body.5
    </p>
    <p>
      During the period that Humbert occupied Castlebar&mdash;that is, from the
      27th of August until the morning of the 4th of September&mdash;the French
      behaved with the greatest moderation, protecting the Protestants from
      insult, and repressing every attempt at cruelty on the part of their
      ignorant and useless allies. Invariably, the invaders regarded the Irish
      mob who accompanied them as a pack of senseless savages, and no pains were
      taken to disguise these feelings of contempt. &lsquo;The French,&rsquo; records
      Musgrave, &lsquo;ate the best of meat and bread, drank wine, beer, and coffee,
      and slept on good beds. They compelled the rebels to eat potatoes, drink
      whisky, and sleep on straw. They beat and abused them like dogs, in the
      name of liberty, equality, and fraternity. A volume would not contain an
      account of the brutal actions of the rebels; and the women, who were worse
      than the men, carried off hides, tallow, beef, cloth, and various other
      articles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The wonder was how the zealous papist should come to any terms of
      agreement with a set of men who boasted openly in their hearing &ldquo;that they
      had just driven Mr. Pope out of Italy, and did not expect to find him so
      suddenly in Ireland.&rdquo; It astonished the French officers to hear the
      recruits when they offered their services declare &ldquo;that they were come to
      take arms for France and the <i>Blessed Virgin</i>.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Irish priesthood the French officers exhibited a marked antipathy.
      Frequently a latent hatred of Protestants became too apparent, but any
      attempt, and many were made, to give a religious turn to the war was on
      the French part furiously repelled.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>o reinforcements
      had arrived from France; no insurrectionary movement in the other
      provinces followed the descent at Killalla and the unexpected success at
      Castlebar. The game was played; Lord Cornwallis was within thirty miles;
      another day, and surrender would be inevitable; but still a chance might
      be &lsquo;upon the die,&rsquo; and, like a brave adventurer, Humbert determined to put
      it to the hazard. After mature consideration he decided to march in a
      northerly direction, as that part of the country he understood to be
      disaffected, and also the route leading through Sligo and Donegal was
      tolerably free from troops, and consequently more open to him.
      Accordingly, on the night of the 3rd of September he sent off his baggage
      and cannon, with part of his troops, towards Sligo, and about seven next
      morning set out with the remainder, about 400 in number. With the
      abandonment of the capital of Mayo, Humbert&rsquo;s Irish career may be said to
      have closed, and probably the most summary but faithful account of his
      extraordinary campaign is contained in his own report to the French
      Directory:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;After having obtained the greatest successes, and made the arms of the
      French republic to triumph during my stay in Ireland, I have at length
      been obliged to submit to a superior force of 30,000 troops, commanded by
      Lord Cornwallis. I am a prisoner of war on my parole.&rsquo; Never a despatch
      more brief, nor yet more true.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four days had passed since the French and their auxiliaries had abandoned
      Castlebar (on being apprised of Humbert&rsquo;s retreat Colonel Crawford
      advanced, and at nine o&rsquo;clock the same evening Castlebar was occupied by
      the royalists), and during that time they had been harassed continually.
      So closely were they pressed that the fusilade between their rear-guard
      and the advance of the royalists was almost incessant. His great
      superiority in cavalry enabled Lord Lake to hang closely on their rear,
      from which it was impossible to shake him off, and by mounting light
      infantry behind dragoons, so vigorously was Humbert pushed that he was
      obliged to halt the head of his column and receive an attack from the
      advancing enemy.
    </p>
    <p>
      While forming the leading division the rear-guard, under Sarazin, were
      overtaken within a mile of Ballynamuck, and that general, who commanded <i>en
      second</i>, at once surrendered. Indeed, in doing this Sarazin exercised a
      sound discretion in preventing the useless expenditure of human blood,
      and, from the daring intrepidity of his character, the sacrifice, most
      painful to a soldier&rsquo;s feelings, would never have been made by him until
      every hope was over.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following circumstances, as Musgrave has related, attended the
      surrender of the French:&mdash;&lsquo;The Earl of Roden and Colonel Crawford,
      who led on the advanced guard, consisting of his lordship&rsquo;s Fencibles,
      perceiving an officer who seemed desirous to communicate with them, Lord
      Roden ordered his trumpet to sound, which was answered by the French, when
      his lordship and the colonel advanced into the French lines. The officer
      politely asked them what their wishes were. They answered to stop the
      effusion of blood, and desired them to surrender. The officer said that he
      did not command, but that he would go to General Humbert, which he
      accordingly did. Humbert came up, asked the same question, and received a
      similar answer. He then demanded half an hour to give a final answer,
      which was granted on condition that he halted his troops; to which he made
      no reply, but retreated with precipitation. Lord Roden then ordered his
      trumpet to sound the advance, and came up to the first and second brigade
      of the French army, who surrendered to about 300 cavalry under his
      lordship and Colonel Crawford. After this they advanced with about twenty
      dragoons and took possession of the French guns. Shortly after Humbert
      rallied his grenadiers, the only part of the army, except the chasseurs,
      that had not surrendered, consisting of about 400 men, who surrounded Lord
      Roden and his twenty dragoons. They were given in charge to the hussars.
      While they were their prisoners&mdash;which lasted about fifteen minutes&mdash;the
      French officers loaded the United Irishmen, their allies, with execrations
      for having deceived and disappointed them by inviting them to undertake a
      fruitless expedition. They also declared that the people of Ireland were
      the most treacherous and cowardly they ever knew. Lord Roden and Colonel
      Crawford continued prisoners till his regiment of Fencibles advanced in
      quest of their colonel, which the French hussars perceiving, requested
      that his lordship would desire them to halt, as they meant to surrender,
      and by doing so he prevented them from being cut to pieces.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Gordon&rsquo;s authority, &lsquo;the troops of General Humbert were
      found, when prisoners, to consist of 748 privates and 96 officers, a loss
      of 228 being sustained since their first landing at Killalla.&rsquo; The story
      is incomplete without recounting the fate of their misguided auxiliaries.
      It would appear that the soldiers of the <i>grande nation</i> and their
      Irish allies were heartily tired of each other, and both sides complained
      bitterly, and apparently with reason.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the commencement of Humbert&rsquo;s movement towards the north until his
      surrender, not an hour passed without the vengeance of the royalists
      felling on the deluded wretches, who still continued rather to embarrass
      than assist the French army while retreating. Every straggler that was
      overtaken was cut down by the Hompeschers and Foxhunters who hung upon
      Humbert&rsquo;s rear; and when the invaders laid down their arms at Ballinamuck,
      if blood could have atoned for treason, it was fearfully exacted, for the
      sword and halter were used with an unsparing hand. It is impossible to
      form any correct estimate of the number sacrificed to the fury of the
      soldiery. During the pursuit of Humbert, as the rebels preserved not even
      the semblance of order, but straggled where they pleased, it was not
      unusual to find them sleeping in dozens in the fields, some from fatigue,
      and more from drunkenness. No questions were asked; the <i>coup de sabre</i>
      when on march, the arm of the next tree, if halting, ended all inquiry. At
      Ballinamuck <i>va victis</i> was pronounced, no quarter was given, and, to
      use Musgrave&rsquo;s words, &lsquo;dreadful havoc&rsquo; was made among the unfortunate
      wretches, who were excluded from mercy and cut down by the hundred.

      has executed this characteristic scene pertaining to the destructive
      proceedings which were so significant of the rebellion&mdash;<i>con amore</i>;
      it is sufficiently marked by George Cruikshank&rsquo;s peculiar genius for
      conveying a full sense of boisterous exuberance, wherein the tragic
      marches hand-in-hand with the grotesque, and humour of the broadest
      contrasts with terrible episodes, which weirdly impress the imagination.
      In short, this picture may be regarded as the typical contribution of the
      gifted illustrator to Maxwell&rsquo;s <i>History</i>, and, as such, speaks
      sufficiently for itself, telling its moving tale with that native force
      and graphic directness Cruikshank had always at command.

      It may be realised that, to gratify their native love of fun, an Irish mob
      finds in the humours of any given situation the satisfaction of comic
      relief in contrast to absolutely grim terrorism; appreciative touches of
      these congenial qualities are conspicuous throughout Cruikshank&rsquo;s vividly
      pictorial realisations of the episodes of the rebellion of 1798. Herein
      souvenirs of the humorous touches of the amenities of Donnybrook Fair lend
      their spice of rough fun to relieve the gloomier horrors inseparable from
      the subject, while the spirit of general destruction is in full swing, and
      the intoxicating influence of wantonly wrecking everything at hand, or
      within reach, is producing chaos and spreading annihilation around; the
      whole spectacle of reckless ruin to characteristically conclude with a
      grand conflagration of everything destructible, to put the final touches

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>wo names most
      intimately connected with the Irish Rebellion are surrounded by an
      atmosphere of sentiment and the glamour of romance, which endears their
      memories to their admirers at this distant date. The untoward fate of one,
      the unfortunate enthusiast Lord Edward Fitzgerald, commences the history
      of the insurrection; the last, Robert Emmett, comes to complete the story,
      his episode almost as an anticlimax. Both were lives of promise, miserably
      thrown away, and it is recognised that both these victims rebels
      destroying a house furniture of misapplied talents were worthy of a better
      fate, and capable of higher things.
    </p>
    <p>
      Robert Emmett was the son of a respectable physician in Dublin, and was
      the younger brother of Thomas Adis Emmett, a gifted barrister who had been
      a conspicuous member of the rebel Directory in the fateful 1798. Robert
      Emmett was by natural gifts qualified to figure as a hero of romance, and
      his name is so regarded by sympathisers, even after the lapse of a
      century, wherein his fame has fitfully survived. He was a young man of
      fine talents rather than solidity of judgment, possessing uncommon
      eloquence, and no inconsiderable portion of courage and activity. He was
      not unqualified for the part he had undertaken, and for a service so
      pregnant with difficulty and danger his sanguine temperament was a
      necessary adjunct. He had quitted Ireland after the unfortunate
      termination of the former conspiracy, and resided in different parts of
      the Continent, but principally in France, till Christmas 1802, when he
      returned to his native country, filled with ambitious projects of an
      unreasonable and uncompromisingly revolutionary nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;A quotation from one of his speeches, when a lad at Dublin University,
      proves the early political bias of his mind. After a brilliant eulogy on
      the French republic, he concluded with a remark sufficiently expressive:&mdash;&ldquo;When
      a people, advancing rapidly in knowledge and power, perceive at last how
      far their government is lagging behind them, what then, I ask, is to be
      done in such a case? Why, <i>pull the government up to the people!</i>&rdquo;
       The consequences of indulging in such language at such a time may be
      imagined&mdash;Emmett was struck off the College roll.&rsquo;&mdash;<i>Memoir of
      Robert Emmett.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      On his arrival in Ireland he first went into a state of the most perfect
      obscurity at the house of a Mrs. Palmer, at Harold&rsquo;s Cross, where he
      assumed the name of Hewitt. The nature of his mission did not admit of his
      remaining in this retreat longer than was necessary to mature his plans
      and form his connections. About the end of April, a house and premises of
      some extent, formerly a malt-house, and which had been long unoccupied,
      were taken in Marshall&rsquo;s Alley, Thomas Street, sufficiently obscure to
      escape detection, and yet near enough to the heart of the city to effect
      the most desperate purposes. In this place Emmett lodged for nearly two
      months, with no better accommodation than a <i>paillasse</i>, and
      surrounded by from fourteen to twenty associates. A depot of arms was here
      formed on a large scale; muskets and other weapons were procured from time
      to time to a considerable amount, and a large manufacture of pikes was
      secretly carried on. There was a group of tailor hands employed in making
      rebel uniforms of green.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br /><a name="linkimage-0038" id="linkimage-0038"> </a>

    </h5>
    <p>
      &lsquo;One of these dépôts was set apart for the manufacture of gunpowder and
      the construction of weapons. Some idea of the industry with which Emmett
      accumulated these implements of deadly vengeance, and his sanguine
      reliance upon thousands responding to the tocsin of insurrection, may be
      formed from the catalogue of the contents of his magazine:&mdash;It
      comprised forty-five pounds of cannon-powder, in bundles; eleven boxes of
      fine powder; one hundred bottles filled with powder, enveloped with
      musket-balls and covered with canvas; two hundred and forty-six hand
      grenades, formed of ink-bottles filled with powder and encircled with
      buck-shot; sixty-two thousand rounds of musket-ball cartridge; three
      bushels of musket-balls; a quantity of tow mixed with tar and gunpowder
      and other combustible matter, for throwing against woodwork, which when
      ignited would cause an instantaneous conflagration; sky-rockets and other
      signals, etc.; false beams filled with combustibles, with not less than
      twenty thousand pikes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The conspirators occasionally pressed not only horses but men into their
      service, and forced the latter to work at different employments necessary
      for the object in view while confined in the depot. At the same time
      stores of arms and gunpowder were deposited at the residences of others of
      their accomplices in convenient stations of the city. The whole of the
      conspiracy had, however, been nearly overthrown and exposed by an
      explosion which took place in Patrick Street. By the ability of the
      conspirators, or the security of their adversaries, the accident was
      overlooked, or at least represented as unconnected with any treasonable
      design. Emmett once more changed the place of his concealment,
      apprehending the explosion would lead to untimely disclosures, removing to
      one of his dépôts situated in Mass Lane. &ldquo;Here he strove to make, as far
      as possible, by increased exertions, amends for the recent loss. So
      restless was he, that he sought no further repose than that he derived
      from occasionally reclining upon a mattress, placed in the midst of the
      workmen, from which he could by night and day observe the progress of, and
      direct and animate their labours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">EMMETT PREPARING FOR THE INSURRECTION</span>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;At length the preparations were complete, or the funds of the
      conspirators exhausted, and the 23rd of July 1803 was appointed for a
      general insurrection. Though the persons immediately connected with the
      principals in the plot&mdash;Emmett, Dowdall, and Quigley&mdash;did not
      exceed from eighty to one hundred persons, they were so far misled as to
      the state of the public mind, that they expected the spirit of rebellion
      would pervade the kingdom. The stopping of the mail-coaches was to be the
      signal of revolt in the country. The immediate object of the insurgents in
      the metropolis was the castle (&ldquo;as it was felt that to have command over
      the seat they might speedily secure the power of government&rdquo;), and the
      vicinity of the depot in Thomas Street was calculated to favour the
      intended enterprise against this seat of the government. Various rumours
      had been afloat for a. few days previous, that &ldquo;a rising,&rdquo; as it was
      termed, was intended; but the reports were so contradictory that the
      government was unable to take any measures of precaution further than the
      doubling of patrols in certain stations. Towards dusk on the 23rd of July,
      Emmett prepared for the anticipated action by superintending the
      distribution of arms and ammunition (of which he had a large supply)
      amongst the multitude that had congregated before the headquarters of the
      projected rebellion. But we must not omit to mention that previous to the
      evening the ill-success of the enterprise had been omened forth by the
      retreat of the Kildare men, who, after marching into the capital, were
      fortunately persuaded by their leaders to disband and return home.&rsquo; What
      ensued has been graphically described by one of Emmett&rsquo;s coadjutors:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;About six o&rsquo;clock Emmett, Malachy, one or two others, and myself put on
      our green uniform, trimmed with gold lace, and selected our arms. The
      insurgents, who had all day been well plied with whisky&rsquo; (this paragraph
      is most significant), &lsquo;began to prepare for commencing an attack upon the
      castle; and when all was ready, Emmett made an animated address to the
      conspirators. At eight precisely we sallied out of the depot, and when we
      arrived in Thomas Street the insurgents gave three deafening cheers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The consternation excited by our presence defies description. Every
      avenue emptied its curious hundreds, and almost every window exhibited
      half a dozen inquisitive heads, while peaceable shopkeepers ran to their
      doors, and beheld with amazement a lawless band of armed insurgents, in
      the midst of a peaceable city, an hour at least before dark. The scene at
      first might have appeared amusing to a careless spectator, from the
      singular and dubious character which the riot wore; but when the rocket
      ascended and burst over the heads of the people, the aspect of things
      underwent an immediate and wonderful change. The impulse of the moment was
      self-preservation, and those who, a few minutes before, seemed to look on
      with vacant wonder, now assumed a face of horror, and fled with
      precipitation. The wish to escape was simultaneous; and the eagerness with
      which the people fled before us impeded their flight, as they crowded upon
      each other in the entrance of alleys, courtways, and lanes; while the
      screams of women and children were frightful and heart-rending.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;To the castle!&rdquo; cried our enthusiastic leader, drawing his sword, and
      his followers appeared to obey. But when we reached the market-house our
      adherents had wonderfully diminished, there not being more than twenty
      insurgents with us.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Fire the rocket!&rdquo; cried Malachy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;&ldquo;Hold awhile,&rdquo; said Emmett, snatching the match from the man&rsquo;s hand who
      was applying it. &ldquo;Let no lives be unnecessarily lost. Run back and see
      what detains the men?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Malachy obeyed, and we remained near the market-house, waiting their
      arrival, until the soldiers approached.&rsquo; 
    </p>

      <span class="head">THE MURDER OF LORD KILWARDEN</span>

      with his deluded followers, and the work was less bloodthirsty; but the
      hordes armed by their enthusiastic and visionary general of the moment
      were of a combustible nature, and having weapons in their hands, speedily
      began ruthlessly murdering innocent people:&mdash;&lsquo;The conspirators
      assembled previously in the depot did not exceed the number of fifty, but
      pikes and other weapons were liberally dispersed among the mob, and the
      insurgents soon swelled to the amount, it is said, of about five hundred.
      The night was dark, and the scene is described as tremendous; groups of
      pikemen and other insurgents were dispersed in various parts of the
      vicinity of the scene of action, while others were calling out for arms,
      and led in crowds to the grand depot. Directly these mob-valiant ruffians
      secured their weapons, they set about employing them to deadly purpose.

    <p>
      It was thus that the life of Lord Kilwarden, the eminent and venerable
      chief-justice, was wantonly taken. Driving to the castle <i>via</i> Thomas
      Street, the carriage, unhappily for its inmates, fell into the thick of
      the rebels at the beginning of their excited career. It is related that
      the judge had formerly tried and sentenced to death a youth, convicted of
      treason, who, unlike his confederates, refused to accept pardon upon the
      condition of leaving the country. After the death of this misguided lad,
      his relatives, readily listening to every misrepresentation which
      flattered their resentment, became persuaded that the attorney-general had
      selected the youthful victim in question to suffer the utmost severity of
      the law (his companions having consented to expatriate themselves). One of
      his family connections, a person named Shannon, was an insurgent on the
      23rd of July; and when Lord Kilwarden, hearing the popular cry of
      vengeance, exclaimed from his carriage, &ldquo;It is I, Kilwarden, chief-justice
      of the King&rsquo;s Bench!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then,&rdquo; cried Shannon, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re the man that I want!&rdquo; and plunged a pike
      into his lordship&rsquo;s body.&rsquo;

    <p>
      The narrative as related by one of those present is as follows:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It was during the height of the insurrection that the venerable
      magistrate, accompanied by his daughter, Miss Wolfe, and his nephew, a
      clergyman, arrived in Thomas Street in his way from his country-house to
      the castle. Lord Kilwarden and Mr. Wolfe, his nephew, were inhumanly
      dragged from the carriage and pierced with innumerable mortal wounds by
      the pikemen. Before he expired he was rescued by a party of military and
      of the police; and hearing some violent expression employed as to the
      punishment of the rebels, he had only time, before he breathed his last,
      to prefer a petition &ldquo;that no man might suffer but by the laws of his
      country.&rdquo; Such a death was more honourable than that of a commander who
      dies in the arms of Victory, and who possibly acts a part to secure a
      posthumous reputation. Miss Wolfe, by the humanity or the heedlessness of
      the mob, effected her escape, and, on foot and unattended, was one of the
      first who arrived at the castle to give notice of the horrors of the
      night. Colonel Browne, a gentleman greatly respected, was another victim
      of the multitude, and was assassinated in the same brutal and cowardly
      manner. On the first alarm he repaired to join his regiment, but
      uninformed of the precise station which was occupied by the rebels, he
      unfortunately, in the darkness of the night, fell in with the main body;
      he received a shot from a blunderbuss, and was almost immediately hewn to
      pieces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Every casual passenger who was not murdered was forced to join the
      insurgents and armed with a pike. This happened even to some gentlemen of
      rank and character. The first check which the rebels experienced was from
      Mr. Edward Wilson, a police magistrate, who, at the head of only eleven
      men, had the courage to approach the scene of insurrection. He had hardly
      arrived at the spot before he found his little party surrounded by a body
      of nearly 300 pikemen. Undismayed by their hostile appearance, he called
      upon them to lay down their arms or he would fire. The rebels appeared
      somewhat confused, but one of them, bolder than the rest, advanced, and
      with his pike wounded Mr. Wilson in the belly, but was instantly shot dead
      by the wounded magistrate. The fire from his men threw the rest of the
      body of assailants into some confusion, but they presently opened to the
      right and left to make way for such of their party as had firearms, when
      Mr. Wilson thought it prudent to retreat towards the Coombe. The rebels
      soon after met with a more formidable assailant in Lieutenant Brady, of
      the 21st Fusileers, who, at the head of only forty men, had the gallantry
      to advance to the attack. He subdivided his little force into smaller
      parties, and though assailed by bottles and stones from the houses, and
      with shot from the alleys and entries, kept up so warm and well-directed a
      fire that the insurgents, numerous as they were, soon fled in different
      directions. Lieutenant Coltman, of the 9th regiment of foot, also at the
      head of only four men of his own regiment and some yeomanry of the Barrack
      division in coloured clothes, in all but twenty-eight, hastened to the
      scene of action, and was successful in dispersing the mob, and securing
      some of the most desperate of the offenders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The military now poured in from all quarters; the rebels were routed with
      considerable slaughter, and, before twelve, the insurrection was
      completely quelled.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The brief and sanguinary affray, which was fully detailed in the evidence
      given on the trial of the chief conspirator, we think will bear us out
      regarding the in competency of the leaders and the general inefficiency of
      an Irish mob. More was in Emmett&rsquo;s favour than he was entitled to have
      expected. The government, although rumour was rife with alarm, had turned
      a deaf ear to every attempt to awake it from its culpable security. The
      detective police of that day, a crew of mercenary bloodhounds, showed that
      within the heart of the city treasonable plans could be matured, and not a
      functionary suspect it. To stimulate Sirr and his myrmidons to exertion,
      crime was not to be prevented but committed, and a regular price must
      first be placed upon the offender. The apathy of the government and the
      imbecility of the conspiracy were worthy of each other. On the night of
      the 23rd of July one hundred determined men, by a well-arranged <i>coup de
      main</i>, might have easily obtained possession of the castle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with that success, twelve hours would have ended the treasonable
      triumph. More blood might have been shed, but the end would have been the
      same, and by noon the next day the insurrection would have terminated as
      it commenced&mdash;in slaughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">TRIAL, CONVICTION, AND EXECUTION OF ROBERT EMMETT</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he madly
      infatuated leaders of this desperate and futile attempt contrived to evade
      their deluded followers before the crisis of the outbreak, in spite of
      their conspicuous uniforms and trappings. Favoured by the darkness, Emmett
      and his lieutenants, decked in their warlike panoply, contrived to escape
      from the city which their rash enterprise had stirred into wild
      excitement, and headed to that haunt of outlawed and desperate
      malefactors, the mountain range of Wicklow, where they foiled to raise the
      late rebels. Under this rebuff, for better security, the party separated,
      each adopting the best means within his power to evade the now uplifted
      hand of outraged justice. Emmett, it is said, might possibly have quitted
      the country in a fishing boat, but his wild and ardent attachment to a
      daughter of the celebrated Curran induced him to return to the metropolis
      and seek a parting interview with his mistress. None but a madman would
      have risked the dangerous experiment; but Emmett appears to have been
      influenced in all his actions by the wildest impulse, and, accordingly, he
      regained the city safely, and again took up his quarters in his old
      concealment, Harold&rsquo;s Cross. Here he was tracked by the bloodhound who had
      successfully trapped Lord Edward Fitzgerald and the many misguided
      enthusiasts who had similarly played with treason under mistaken ambition.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrested by Town-Major Sirr on the 25th of August, a special commission
      was immediately issued, Lord Norbury presiding. The evidence was clear,
      decisive, and direct, and went over and unmistakably proved the facts as
      already described.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of Emmett&rsquo;s arrest, as related by Major Henry Charles Sirr,
      appropriately closes the history: &lsquo;I went, in the evening of the 25th of
      August, to the house of one Palmer. I had heard there was a stranger in
      the back-parlour. I rode, accompanied by a man on foot; I desired the man
      to knock at the door. He did, and it was opened by a girl. I alighted, and
      ran directly into the back-parlour. I saw the prisoner sitting at dinner;
      the woman of the house was there, and the girl who opened the door was the
      daughter of the woman of the house. I desired them to withdraw. I asked
      the prisoner his name; he told me his name was Cunningham. I gave him in
      charge to the man who accompanied me, and went into the next room to ask
      the woman and daughter about him; they told me his name was Hewitt. I went
      back and asked how long he had been there? He said he came that morning.
      He had attempted to escape before I returned, for he was bloody, and the
      man said he knocked him down with a pistol. I then went to Mrs. Palmer,
      who said he had lodged there for a month. I then judged he was a person of
      some importance. When I first went in there was a paper on the chair,
      which I put into my pocket (Emmett&rsquo;s fervid proclamation). I then went to
      the canal bridge for a guard, having desired him to be in readiness as I
      passed by. I planted a sentry over him, and desired the non-commissioned
      officer to surround the house with sentries while I searched it. I then
      examined Mrs. Palmer, and took down her account of the prisoner, during
      which time I heard a noise, as if an escape was attempted. I instantly ran
      to the back part of the house, as the most likely part for him to get out
      at; I saw him going off, and ordered a sentinel to fire, and then pursued
      him myself, regardless of the order. The sentry snapped, but the musket
      did not go off. I overtook the prisoner, and he said, &ldquo;I surrender!&rdquo; I
      searched him, and found some papers upon him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      On the witness expressing concern at the necessity of the prisoner&rsquo;s being
      treated so roughly, the prisoner observed, &lsquo;that all was fair in war.&rsquo; The
      prisoner, when brought to the castle, acknowledged that his name was
      Emmett.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his address to the jury Mr. Conyngham Plunket, as counsel for the
      Crown, laid stress upon the revolutionary proclamation drawn up by Emmett,
      and pointed out the condemnatory nature of this incendiary document:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Under what circumstances is he taken? In the room in which he was, upon a
      chair near the door, is found an address to the government of the country,
      and in the very first paragraph of that address the composer of it
      acknowledges himself to be the head of a conspiracy for the overthrow of
      the government which he addresses, telling them, in diplomatic language,
      what conduct the undersigned will be compelled to adopt if they shall
      presume to execute the law. He is the leader, whose nod is a Fiat, and he
      warns them of the consequences!
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;And how was this revolution to be effected? The proclamation conveys an
      insinuation that it was to be effected by their own force, entirely
      independent of foreign assistance. Why? Because it was well known that
      there remained in this country few so depraved, so lost to the welfare of
      their native land, that would not shudder at forming an alliance with
      France, and therefore the people of Ireland are told, &ldquo;the effort is to be
      entirely your own, independent of foreign aid.&rdquo; But how does this tally
      with the time when the scheme was first hatched&mdash;the very period of
      the commencement of the war with France? How does this tally with the fact
      of consulting in the depot about co-operating with the French, which has
      been proved in evidence? But, gentlemen, out of the proclamation I convict
      him of duplicity. He tells the government of the country not to resist
      their mandate, or think they can effectually suppress rebellion by putting
      down the present attempt, but that &ldquo;they will have to crush a greater
      exertion, rendered still greater by foreign assistance&rdquo;; so that upon the
      face of the proclamation they avowed, in its naked deformity, the
      abominable plan of an alliance with the usurper of the French throne to
      overturn the ancient constitution of the land, and to substitute a new
      republic in its place.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      <span class="head">CONCLUSION OF EMMETT&rsquo;S EXALTED DEFENCE</span>
    </p>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>fter the verdict
      of guilty was pronounced, the clerk of the Crown asked the condemned &lsquo;what
      he had to say why judgment of death and execution should not be awarded
      against him according to law?&rsquo; Emmett, without precisely defending
      himself, calmly proceeded to pour forth an eloquent impassioned attack
      upon the executive. The concluding passages convey the general tendency of
      his exalted oratory:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have been charged with that importance in the efforts to emancipate my
      countrymen as to be considered the keystone of the combination of
      Irishmen, or, as your lordship expressed it, &ldquo;the life and blood of the
      conspiracy.&rdquo; You do me honour overmuch&mdash;you have given to a subaltern
      all the credit of a superior. There are men engaged in this conspiracy who
      are not only superior to me, but even to your computation of yourself, my
      lord; before the splendour of whose genius and virtues I should bow with
      respectful deference, and who would think themselves disgraced to be
      called your friend, and who would not disgrace themselves by shaking your
      blood-stained hand. [Again the judge, as frequently in the course of this
      bitter harangue of Emmett&rsquo;s, felt called upon to interrupt him.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What, my lord, shall you tell me on the passage to that scaffold which
      that tyranny, of which you are only the intermediary executioner, has
      erected for my murder, that I am accountable for all the blood that has
      and will be shed in this struggle of the oppressed against the oppressor?
      Shall you tell me this, and shall I be so very a slave as not to repel it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I do not fear to approach the Omnipotent Judge, to answer for the conduct
      of my whole life, and am I to be appalled and falsified by a mere remnant
      of mortality! By you, too, who, if it were possible to collect all the
      innocent blood that you have shed in your unhallowed ministry in one
      reservoir, your lordship might swim in it. [Here the judge interfered.]
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Let no man dare, when I am dead, to charge me with dishonour; let no man
      attaint my memory by believing that I could have engaged in any cause but
      of my country&rsquo;s liberty and independence, or that I became the pliant
      minion of power in the oppression or the miseries of my countrymen. The
      proclamation of the provisional government speaks for our views; no
      inference can be tortured from it to countenance barbarity or debasement
      at home, or subjection, humiliation, or treachery from abroad. I would not
      have submitted to a foreign oppressor, for the same reason that I would
      resist the present domestic oppressor. In the dignity of freedom I would
      have fought on the threshold of my country, and its enemies should only
      enter by passing over my lifeless corpse. And am I, who lived but for my
      country, and who have subjected myself to the dangers of the jealous and
      watchful oppressor and the bondage of the grave, only to give my
      countrymen their rights, and my country her independence. Am I to be
      loaded with calumny and not suffered to resent or repel it?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If the spirits of the illustrious dead participate in the concerns and
      cares of those who are dear to them in this transitory life, O ever dear
      and venerable shade of my departed father, look down with scrutiny upon
      the conduct of your suffering son, and see if I have even for a moment
      deviated from those principles of morality and patriotism which it was
      your care to instil into my youthful mind, and for which I am now about to
      offer up my life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My lords, you are impatient for the sacrifice. The blood which you seek
      is not congealed by the artificial terrors that surround your victim; it
      circulates warmly and unruffled through the channels which God created for
      nobler purposes, but which you are bent to destroy, for purposes so
      grievous that they cry to heaven. Be ye patient! I have but a few words
      more to say. I am going to my cold and silent grave&mdash;my lamp of life
      is nearly extinguished&mdash;my race is run&mdash;the grave opens to
      receive me, and I sink into its bosom! I have but one request to ask at my
      departure from this world&mdash;it is the charity of its silence! Let no
      man write my epitaph; for as no man who knows my motives dare now
      vindicate them, let not prejudice or ignorance asperse them. Let them and
      me repose in obscurity and peace, and my tomb remain uninscribed, until
      other times and other men can do justice to my character. When my country
      takes her place among the nations of the earth, then, and not till then,
      let my epitaph be written. I have done!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Execution followed fast upon conviction, and Emmett suffered the penalty
      of high treason on the following day. The scene of his crime was chosen as
      the place of his punishment, and in Thomas Street the unfortunate
      gentleman met his fate with a calm and manly resignation, which elicited
      the sympathy of all who witnessed the painful occurrence.
    </p>
    <p>
      If any sparks of disaffection lingered in the country, the mad outbreak of
      this deluded man finally extinguished them. The democratic feeling ten
      years before rife in the north of Ireland, and prevalent among the
      Presbyterians, had, long before Emmett&rsquo;s <i>emeute</i>, been generally
      repudiated; a political change had been wrought rapidly in Ulster, and the
      educated and intelligent portion of the kingdom, whom American connection
      and French example influenced for a time, had detected the unsound
      principles of theoretic liberty, and disowned the rotten foundations upon
      which mob-governments are superstructed. When Russell, an early example of
      the republican school, attempted to operate coincidently with Emmett&rsquo;s
      deluded attempt in the north, not half a dozen fools could be found to
      listen to delusory principles which had been tested and found wanting; and
      when he later suffered the extreme penalty of the law at Downpatrick, the
      utmost charity to which his quondam admirers reached was to declare that
      he was insane&mdash;a conclusion no doubt correct.
    </p>

contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
